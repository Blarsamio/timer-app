Short descriptions of the offered counterposes are provided at the end of this chapter. Another option after coming out of a pose is to remain completely still, in a Shavasana position, and monitor the rebound effect for a minute or two.
Many of these asanas will be familiar to experienced yoga students. However, the names may be different in the yin tradition, and this is deliberate. For example, the yin pose of Swan looks identical to the yang pose of Pigeon, but in the yin practice, we relax the muscles; our intention is to soak deeply into the joints and the deep tissues wrapping them, not the more superficial tissues of the muscles. There is no consensus in the world of yoga on naming asanas; different names abound. The ones shown here are the names more commonly used in the Yin Yoga tradition, but they are not universal, and there may be other names for these postures.

INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: middle and upper back (extension).
Secondary targeted areas: neck (extension) and arms/shoulders (flexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you have a bad neck, take care, as the looking-forward option could strain it too much or cause sensations of lightheadedness.
Be aware of any tingling in the hands or fingers! This is often a sign that a nerve is being compressed, and if you continue to compress it, you may permanently damage it. If you feel tingling, adjust the arm and hand positions (fig. 2) or skip the pose entirely.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
From your hands and knees, walk your hands forward, allowing your chest to drop toward the floor (fig. 1). Keep your hips above your knees. Find the neutral position for your arm width (which may or may not be shoulder-width apart).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
If shoulder pain or tingling prevents the arms from going overhead, move them further apart or rest your forehead on your forearms (fig. 2).
You may also stretch out just one arm at a time (fig. 3), resting the head upon the other forearm.
If you’re very flexible, you can bring the chin to the floor and look ahead, but this could strain the neck.
If your knees are uncomfortable here, place a blanket underneath them. Toes can be tucked under (fig. 2).
The chest can rest on a bolster, allowing the body to relax (fig. 4). Another option is to rest your outstretched hands on blocks (fig. 5).
If this pose just doesn’t work for you, another way to get the extension in the upper back is to recline over a bolster, as shown in fig. 6.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Either move back into Child’s Pose or slide forward onto your belly.
COUNTERPOSES
Lying on your abdomen or in Child’s Pose can be nice here. Since this posture is a backbend (extension), Child’s Pose is a good choice for a counterpose because it is a mild forward fold (flexion) of the spine.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations (compression) along the middle and upper spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
Stress in the chest may stimulate your Stomach and Spleen meridians.
This posture may juice up the arm meridians through the shoulders, especially the Heart and Lung meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes.
If resting your chin on floor, the hold may need to be shorter. Carefully watch the sensations in the neck.
OTHER NOTES
Other common names for this pose are Half Down Dog and Puppy Dog. Mildly extends and compresses the lower spine.
The head and neck also extend if the student looks forward, bringing the chin to the floor.
If you are worried about the cleanliness of your yoga mat, use a towel or blanket under your forehead, as shown in fig. 1.
Extension of the upper back may be good for hyperkyphosis.
We spend a lot of time flexing our upper spine throughout the day (sitting at desks, etc.).
This pose is a great way to create some balance for the upper back.
If the knees spread apart, this becomes Frog Pose! Can be used as a precursor for deeper backbends.
If you feel pinching in the back of the shoulders, you may be reaching a compression point.
Abducting the arms (moving them farther apart) may allow you to go around this point.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the ankles (plantarflexion). Secondary targeted areas: the knees (full flexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If there is any sharp pain in the ankles, back off.
This can be painful on a hard floor, so try placing a blanket or towel under the feet to cushion them.
Knee issues (knee replacement, ligament or cartilage damage, chronic inflammation) may prevent sitting on the heels; sitting on a cushion may be helpful. You can also try placing a rolled-up towel behind the knees or a cushion between the thighs and calves.
If your ankles or knees still complain, this may not be the pose for you. Skip it and try Swan or Dragon Pose (where the back leg’s foot will also be plantarflexed but with much less stress).
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Begin by sitting on the heels (fig. 3). If sitting on the heels is too challenging, sit with blocks or cushions between your feet. This may be enough for the ankles! Check in with how it feels before trying other options. If it is too intense, lean back on the hands (fig. 2) and check in again.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Leaning back on the hands (fig. 2) is the easiest, least stressful position, but beware of collapsing backward. Keep the heart forward, and imagine you are trying to do a backbend.
After a few moments, bring the hands to the floor or to blocks beside your legs (fig. 3). Padding under the knees may make the pose more accessible (fig. 4).
Most challenging is holding the knees and gently pulling them upward (fig. 1).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Lean forward and bring your hands to the floor beside the knees. Slowly step one foot at a time back to a push-up position or just lie on your belly.
COUNTERPOSES
Push-up, Plank on elbows or any posture that straightens the legs and tucks the toes under. Dangling or squatting.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the top of the foot may stimulate the Stomach meridians, while sensations along the back of the calves and thighs may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians. Any sensations of stress along the top of the thigh may indicate stimulation of the Stomach and Spleen meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
One to 3 minutes, especially if the sensations are relatively intense. You may eventually be able to sit like this for a very long time.
OTHER NOTES
This is a nice counterpose for many postures that dorsiflex the feet, such as Toe Squat, Down Dog, Squat and some cross-legged seated meditations. For some people, it can even be therapeutic for the knees.
Sitting on the heels is known as Seiza (a Japanese meditation position) but B.K.S. Iyengar calls this Virasana. He doesn’t suggest lifting up the knees. His version involves sitting between the feet if possible. (Other teachers call sitting on the feet Vajrasana, but Iyengar calls that a variation of Virasana.) He recommends holding this pose for 1 minute initially, and then working up to 5 minutes. He claims it can help strengthen the arches of the feet, fix flat feet, relieve gout, improve circulation in the feet, relieve heel spurs, knee pain and knee inflammation, and even correct herniated discs. 4 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the lateral side of the torso, neck and hips (side flexion). Secondary targeted area: the armpits (abduction).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you are prone to tingling in the hands when extending your arms overhead, you may need to place a bolster under the arm or simply bring the hands down.
If you have low back issues, you may wish to not go too deep in this pose.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Lying on your back with your legs together and straight on the floor, reach the arms overhead and clasp your hands or elbows. With your buttocks firmly glued to the earth, move your upper body to the right. When you have gone as far as you can, move the legs (fig. 2). (Note the order! It is easier to move the legs, so move those last.) Arch like a nice, ripe banana. Be careful not to twist or roll your hips off the floor. Find your first edge. When your body opens more, move both feet further to the right and pull your upper body further to the right as well.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
After marinating for a while, try crossing the ankles (fig. 1). Most students feel the greatest stress by crossing the outside ankle over the inner ankle, but some feel more “locked in” with the other ankle on top. Experiment.
If you feel any tingling in the hands, support the arms with a bolster or rest them on the forehead. If tingling persists, lower the arms.
If your hips tend to roll up, a sandbag or heavy bolster here may be helpful. If it tends to slide off the hip, use a block beside the hip to support it. Sandbags beside the outer foot can also be used to hold the feet in place. Or they can be placed on the hands if the arms are straight overhead (fig. 3).
Pregnant women who are uncomfortable on their backs can try a side bend over a bolster. Have the bolster under the lower ribcage and side belly to maximize the arch as shown in fig. 4.
Another option for pregnant women is to have support under one hip (fig. 5).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Move your legs back to a straight position and bring your arms down. Be still and enjoy the echo of the posture. (Don’t forget to do the other side.)
COUNTERPOSES
Hug the knees to the chest to release the back in a gentle forward fold. Circle the knees to massage the sacrum and lumbar.
Spontaneously erupt into any pose that feels organic.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the side of the hips and torso may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridian. Stress closer to the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
Stress along the arms and into the shoulders while they are overhead may stimulate the Heart and Lung meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Can be held for 3 to 5 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This is a lying down version of Half Moon or Blown Palm.
This is a delicious way to stress the whole side of the body. It works the spine in a lateral flexion (side bend) from the iliotibial (IT) band to the top of the side ribcage. It stretches the oblique abdominal muscles and the side intercostal muscles between the ribs. If you feel tugging at the outside of the hip (the greater trochanter), then you may be working your tensor fascia latae(this is not a drink from Starbucks but the muscle that connects the IT band to the iliac crest) or gluteus maximus, both of which attach to the IT band.
Don’t forget to do both sides; however, you may wish to hold one side longer than the other if you have significant asymmetry in the spine, such as scoliosis. In this case, stress the tight side longer than the open side or skip the open side entirely and do the tight side twice.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the sacrum/low back (extension).
Secondary targeted areas: the arms/shoulders (flexion) when arms are overhead. For many students, having the arms overhead also creates a nice stress in the lower belly. Tension may also arise through the hip flexors.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Students with arthritic hips, hip replacements and low back issues may find the stress here too much. Either modify the pose to be lower or skip this entirely.
If any tingling occurs in the hands when your arms are overhead, rest your forearms on your forehead or a block. If that doesn’t resolve the tingling, lower the arms completely.
This is not ideal for pregnant women, who may prefer to do Sphinx Pose with bolsters under the thighs and elbows.
Contraindications from YIP: anterior total hip replacement, anterolisthesis, arthritis hip, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hernia (abdominal), herniated cervical disc, Lasik surgery, lumbar spinal stenosis, nosebleed.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Start lying on your back with knees bent. Lift the hips high enough to slide a block or bolster under the pelvis. Make sure the support is under the pelvis/sacrum and NOT under the low back (fig. 2). We want the lumbar spine to be unsupported. Do NOT put a block on its thin edge, as that is potentially unstable and could tip while you’re in the pose; only put blocks on their widest sides. If more height is needed, add more blocks.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Once the pelvis is supported, walk the feet away, thus straightening the legs. Legs fully straight (fig. 1) create the deepest stress into the low back, sacrum and hip flexors.
Not quite as deep is resting your legs on another bolster (fig. 3). This should still create a sense of compression in the low back.
After a few minutes, more flexible students may increase the height of the support, perhaps by adding more blocks.
Raising the arms overhead (fig. 1) increases the tension in the lower abdomen and hip flexors. If this creates any tingling or electrical feeling in the hands, there are 2 options to reduce this: rest the arms on a block (fig. 4) or on your forehead.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
This is a surprisingly juicy pose, so come out slowly, gingerly. Start by bending the knees again and walking the feet toward you. Engage your core muscles and then lift your hips just an inch, just enough to allow you to slide the support away. Slowly lower your hips to the floor and pause there in awe.
COUNTERPOSES
Give yourself a minute or so before moving. Since we were extending the spine, a little flexion is nice: hug your knees to your chest.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the sacrum and lower spine may stimulate the Kidney and Urinary Bladder meridians.
Stress along the thighs or lower belly may stimulate the Spleen and Stomach meridians as well as the Kidney meridians.
Stress along the arms and into the shoulders while they are overhead may stimulate the Heart and Lung meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
We can marinate in the pose for a fairly long time, but 3 to 5 minutes should be plenty to start.
OTHER NOTES
This is very similar to Setubandha Sarvangasana, but instead of using our arms to hold the hips up, we use props. This makes it possible to stay in the pose passively for a long time.
Bridge is great preparation for deeper backbends but also a juicy “work-in” to the low back all on its own.
In B.K.S. Iyengar’s version, a bench is used to support the lower body. He recommends holding this pose for 3 minutes initially, and then working up to 5 to 8 minutes. He claims it can help relieve backache and neck strain, prevent varicose veins, improve digestion, relieve headaches and improve blood circulation. 5 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the whole spine (flexion) and hips (flexion, external rotation, abduction).
Secondary targeted areas: the inner thighs/adductors (tension) and the hamstrings (tension).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Can aggravate sciatica. If you have piriformis sciatica, elevate the hips by sitting on a cushion so the knees are below the hips. If you have discogenic sciatica, avoid rounding the spine. In either case, if this pose makes the symptoms worse, avoid it entirely.
Many knees do not like this pose. If your knees complain, have the feet further away, support the thighs with blocks or cushions (fig. 2) or skip this pose.
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: keep the back as neutral as you can. You could choose the reclining version (fig. 3), which many pregnant students prefer, or Wall Butterfly (fig. 4).
If you have had a hip replaced, check with your surgeon before trying this pose. Avoid dropping the head down if you have neck issues.
Contraindications from YIP: arthritis hip, arthritis knee, chondromalacia patellae, herniated lumbar disc, osteoporosis, posterior total hip replacement, retinal tear, retrolisthesis, sacroiliac joint derangement, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Sitting on a cushion, bring the soles of your feet together and then slide them away from you. Consider this to be a “long-legged Butterfly”! Allowing your back to round, fold forward, lightly resting your hands on your feet or on the floor in front of you. Your head can hang down toward your heels (fig. 1).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Elevating the hips with a bolster or cushion will help tilt you forward.
If your neck is too stressed, support your head in your hands, resting your elbows on your thighs or a block, or support your head with a bolster.
You can rest your chest on a bolster positioned across the thighs (fig. 2).
For complaining knees, support the thighs with blocks (fig. 2) or with a bolster under both legs (fig. 5).
Various hand/arm positions are possible: hold your feet, place your hands on the floor in front of you or relax your arms behind the body. Another option is to place blocks under the hands (fig. 6).
If the back doesn’t like this pose, do the reclining variation: lie down, keeping your legs in Butterfly. You may lie on a bolster for support (fig. 3) or rest against a wall.
Another option is the Wall Butterfly, with legs up the wall (fig. 4), which again spares the spine.
Sandbags on the inner thighs, on the feet or on the low back may increase the sensations without you having to go lower (fig. 7). You can even combine the sandbags with blocks under the knees.
Placing a block between the feet increases the amount of abduction in the legs, changing the level of stress in the hips (fig. 7).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Use your hands to push the floor away and slowly roll up.
Before straightening your legs, lean back on your hands to release the hips. Then slowly straighten each leg.
COUNTERPOSES
This was a flexion for the spine so spinal extension is nice. Do a gentle sitting backbend or lie on the belly. You could also do Cat’s Breath or flow into Tabletop (aka Hammock).
Seated twist is another way to release the spine.
This was also an external rotation for the hips, so some internal rotation, like Windshield Wipers, may feel nice.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the outside of the hips may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
Sensations through the inner knees, thighs and groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes or much longer if desired.
OTHER NOTES
A nice way to stress the low back without requiring loose hamstrings.
If the legs are straighter and the feet further away from the groin, the hamstrings will get more stress. If the feet are in closer to the groin, the adductor muscles get more stress.
Sarah Powers suggests that if you only have time for one pose, do Butterfly. It also is a nice way to start a Yin Yoga practice, as it is a gentle way to work into the spine and hips.
If the feet are closer in, tightness in the adductors or low back may prevent you from folding forward. Move the feet farther away. (It is not wrong to do this pose with the feet in close: that will stress the adductor muscles more, but it also prevents many people from flexing at the hips. With the feet further away, more hip flexion is possible, which allows more spinal flexion too.)
This pose is nice for pregnant women because the legs are abducted, providing space for the belly.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this Baddhakonasana (although he suggests having the feet in close to the groin and keeping the spine neutral) and claims it is good for the kidneys and prostate gland, treats urinary problems, prevents hernias, removes heaviness in the testicles, regulates
periods, helps ovaries function properly, and makes childbirth easier. 6

INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the whole spine (flexion and lateral flexion) and hips (flexion, external rotation, abduction).
Secondary targeted areas: the hamstrings (tension). Depending upon how far apart the legs are abducted, there may be some tension in the inner thighs and the inner knee.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Can aggravate sciatica. If you have piriformis sciatica, elevate the hips by sitting on a cushion so the knees are below the hips. If you have discogenic sciatica, avoid rounding the spine. In either case, if symptoms are made worse, avoid this pose entirely.
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: keep the back as neutral as you can.
Beware of any sharp pain in the knees if the legs are wide apart. If you have issues in this area, bring the legs closer together.
If the bent knee complains, place support under that thigh (fig. 2) or move that foot away from the groin. Some students find relief by placing a folded strap or rolled-up towel at the back of the bent knee.
If the hamstrings protest, bend the straight knee and support the thigh with a blanket or block (fig. 2).
Contraindications from YIP: anterior cruciate ligament tear, arthritis hip, arthritis knee, chondromalacia patellae, herniated lumbar disc, ischial bursitis, lateral meniscal tear, medial meniscal tear, osteoporosis, posterior total hip replacement, retrolisthesis, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
From a seated position, draw one foot in toward you and stretch the other leg straight out to the side. Allowing your back to round, fold over the straight leg (fig. 1).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Rounding the spine may place more stress in the fascia of the back; keeping the spine neutral may place more stress on the hips and back of the legs. Which is your targeted area?
If the hamstrings are tight, folding forward may be restricted. Very tight students may bend the knee so much that the foot is on the floor (fig. 3), in which case, they can wrap their arms under the thigh and over time let the leg become a bit straighter.
Reach the opposite hand to the extended foot and/or lower that shoulder to emphasize the side of the spine (fig. 4).
Add a twisting side bend to the spine by resting the elbow on the thigh and the head in that hand (or for more flexible students, by placing the arm alongside the straight leg) and placing the other arm behind the back or over the head. Rotate the chest toward the sky (fig. 5). This deepens the emphasis along the side of the ribs and spine.
Folding down the middle (fig. 6) can change where you feel the stress. Maybe it is more into the adductors/inner groin? You decide whether this is better. This may be a preferred option for pregnant students.
For the Half Frog option, place the foot of the bent knee in Virasana (fig. 7), but only if the knee doesn’t complain. This is one of the few chances we get in yoga to internally rotate at the hip.
For more flexible students who easily bring their chest to their thigh, try placing a bolster under the chest to encourage more spinal flexion (fig. 8).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Slowly roll up, pushing the floor away with your hands. Before straightening the opposite leg, lean back on your hands to release the hips. Then slowly straighten the leg. (Don’t forget to do the other side.)
COUNTERPOSES
This was a flexion for the spine, so spinal extension is nice. Do a gentle sitting backbend or lie on the belly. You could also do Cat’s Breath or flow into Tabletop (aka Hammock).
Seated twist is another way to release the spine.
This was also an external rotation for the hips, so some internal rotation, like Windshield Wipers, may feel nice.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the spine and the back of the straight leg may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
If you are feeling sensations along the outside of the hips or through the sides of the ribs, this pose may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
Sensations through the inner knees, thighs and groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Can be held up to 5 minutes, with variations added after 2 or 3 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This can be great for pregnant women because the legs are abducted, providing space for the belly.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this pose Janusirsasana, but in our version, we are allowing the back to round. He claims that this pose will relieve headaches, improve bladder control, prevent enlarging of the prostate (only in men) and reduce menstrual cramps (only in women), along with relieving vaginal dryness and itching. 7 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the quadriceps and iliopsoas (tension).
Secondary targeted areas: twisting of the spine and perhaps a mild extension of the hips and lumbar.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you have low back issues, go gently. You may not be able to pull the foot away at all. This pose is not recommended for most pregnant women.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Start by sitting with both legs out in front of you. Twist to the right and recline onto your right elbow. Keeping your bottom (right) leg straight, bring your top (left) leg forward and to the side. Bend the bottom leg, bringing that heel toward your buttock. Reach back with your top (left) hand and grab the bottom foot. Pull the foot away from you (fig. 1).
You may begin lying down. From here, roll onto your right side. Keeping your bottom (right) leg straight, bring your top (left) leg forward (to the side). Bend the bottom leg,
bringing that heel toward your buttock. Reach back with your top (left) hand and grab the bottom foot. Pull the foot away from you (fig. 2).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
It’s easiest to be propped up on one arm (fig. 1).
It’s more challenging to recline and look over the shoulder to the bottom foot (fig. 2). This becomes a reclining twist with a backbend. Try pulling the foot away from the buttock; most students will not be able to pull the foot too far, and that’s okay!
If the foot is not reachable, try using a strap (fig. 3).
A bolster under the top leg may also make the pose more accessible (fig. 3). A deeper option is to hold both feet (fig. 4).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Release the bottom foot and roll onto your abdomen. Straighten the bottom leg. Optionally, roll onto your back.
COUNTERPOSES
Hug the knees to the chest to release the low back in a gentle forward fold. Do this either while lying on your back or in Child’s Pose.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the top of the thigh may stimulate the Stomach and Spleen meridians. Sensations along the low back may stimulate the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians.
If you feel a twist through the side of the ribcage, this may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
One minute if done as a counterpose to a forward bend. Can hold for 3 to 5 minutes as a reclining twist.
OTHER NOTES
A nice counterpose to strong forward bends (such as the Snail or Caterpillar).
If you are actively pulling the foot away, the pose becomes yang-like in nature. In this case, you may shorten the time or release the pressure after 1 minute so you can linger longer.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the spine and hips (flexion) and the hamstrings (tension). Secondary targeted areas: the calves (ankle dorsiflexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Can aggravate sciatica. If you have piriformis sciatica, elevate the hips by sitting on a cushion so the knees are below the hips. If you have discogenic sciatica, avoid rounding the spine. In either case, if symptoms are made worse, avoid this pose entirely.
If the hamstrings are very tight, the knees should be bent and supported by a bolster (fig. 2), which allows the hips to flex more.
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: keep the back as neutral as you can (fig. 3) or do the legs-up-the-wall version (fig. 6).
This pose may hyperextend the knees if the legs are straight, but that may be quite good for them. All joints need stress, including the knees, and they are designed to hyperextend a bit. However, if hyperextension is painful for you, keep a little bend there, perhaps with a rolled-up blanket under them.
Most pregnant women should be able to do this pose if they separate their legs enough for their belly to go between them. In this case, it becomes a mini version of the Straddle Pose.
Contraindications from YIP: arthritis hip, gastroesophageal reflux disease, herniated lumbar disc, ischial bursitis, osteoporosis, posterior total hip replacement, retrolisthesis, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, torn hamstring.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Sit on a cushion with both legs straight out in front of you. Fold forward over the legs, allowing your back to round (fig. 1).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Most students have to choose to bend the knees or not. If the hamstrings are tight, the hips won’t flex much, which can be okay, as this will create more stress in the targeted areas. But if you are very tight in the hamstrings, you may not be able to flex the hips enough to come past vertical with your torso: in this case, bend the knees enough to allow gravity to draw your spine into flexion rather than using your abdominal muscles. You can use a bolster under the knees for support (fig. 2) or wrap your arms under them (fig. 3). Also try sitting up on additional cushions to tilt the pelvis more.
Similarly, drawing the chin to the chest, deepening the flexion at the neck, will also increase the stress along the fascial chains of the back body.
If your neck feels strained by the weight of the head, support your head in your hands, resting your elbows on the legs or a bolster (fig. 4).
You can rest your chest on a bolster (fig. 4) to help relax into the pose.
Experiment with hand positions. Rest your elbows on your thighs, bolster (fig. 5) or the floor, or loosely hold the toes with your hands. No need to pull: holding the feet in dorsiflexion will make the tension stronger along the back of the body.
For students who would prefer not to flex the spine at all but still want a lovely hamstring stress, there are a couple of other options: lie on the back with your legs on the wall and a bolster under the pelvis (fig. 6), which is very nice for people who stand all day. Another option here is to place a sandbag on the feet while they are in the air against the wall; or have your legs in the air and hold the feet with a strap (fig. 7); or, more exciting, use a strap looped between the feet and the back of the head (fig. 8). Note: not the back of the neck! Ouch! This is not as challenging at it looks.
In most variations, sandbags along the spine can add a bit of juice if more is desired (fig. 9).
To feel a stress if you’re very flexible and can easily rest your chest on your thighs, you may want to separate your legs just enough that your chest fits between the legs. Need more? Sit on a block and have blocks under the calves, building a platform.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Use your hands to push the floor away and slowly roll up.
Once you are up, lean back on your hands to release the hips and extend the spine.
COUNTERPOSES
This was a flexion for the spine, so spinal extension is nice. Do a gentle sitting backbend or lie on the belly. You could also do Cat’s Breath or flow into Tabletop (aka Hammock).
Seated twist is another way to release the spine.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the back side of the body may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians. Sensations through the low back may stimulate the Kidney line meridian.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes, but in time even more.
OTHER NOTES
Paul Grilley says this pose is excellent for balancing chi flow and preparing the body for meditation.
Keep muscles relaxed, especially in the legs and abdomen.
Make sure the tops of the hips are tilted forward. If the hips are rotating backward, sit on higher cushions and bend the knees more. Let gravity have you! Surrendering is yin.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this pose Paschimottanasana. He claims it cools the brain, normalizes blood pressure, relieves chronic headaches, soothes the heart, massages the adrenal glands and kidneys, tones the bladder and pancreas, treats the entire reproductive system in women, and treats impotence and builds sex control in men. 8 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the spine and hips (flexion).
Secondary targeted areas: the knees (flexion) and ankles (plantarflexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you have diarrhea, are pregnant or have just eaten, either spread the legs apart (fig. 4) or skip this pose.
If you have hip or knee issues, you may need to place a towel or blanket between thighs and calves or avoid the pose altogether.
You may need a blanket or other padding under the ankles to reduce discomfort on the top of the feet.
Contraindications from YIP: anterior cruciate ligament tear, arthritis hip, arthritis knee, bunion, chondromalacia patellae, gastroesophageal reflux disease, herniated lumbar disc, herniated thoracic disc, posterior total hip replacement, retrolisthesis, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Begin by sitting on your heels and then slowly fold forward, bringing your chest to your thighs and your forehead to the earth. Hands go back beside the feet, allowing elbows to bend out to the sides (fig. 1).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Can be done with arms stretched forward, which may avoid placing too much pressure on the neck (fig. 2). This may, however, increase shoulder tension.
Another favorite option is to thread the arms between the legs (fig. 3).
If you prefer not to have your forehead on the floor or mat, place a towel or blanket under your head (fig. 3) or turn your head to one side (fig. 4).
Allow the knees to be as close together as is comfortable, but they do not have to touch. If there is any uncomfortable pinching at the front hips or if there is too much compression in the chest or belly, separate the knees more (fig. 4).
If you cannot get your buttocks to your heels, or if the head or neck feels too much stress, place a bolster under the chest (fig. 5). This is a nice option for pregnant students.
If you crave a bit more stress, sandbags along the spine can feel nice (fig. 6).
You can do this as a preparation for the Frog by spreading the knees wide apart halfway through the pose while continuing to sit on the heels. Optionally, have an arm overhead (fig. 7); we call this the Tadpole.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Use your hands to push the floor away and slowly roll up.
COUNTERPOSES
A counterpose is not normally needed after this pose. Just sit tall or lie down for a moment.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
Sensations along the front body (thighs and belly) may stimulate the Stomach and Spleen meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
If used as a counterpose, hold for up to 1 minute.
If used as a yin pose on its own, hold for 3 to 5 minutes. Some people can stay forever! (That may be a bit too long.) If you cannot get your head to the floor, 5 minutes may be too long.
OTHER NOTES
A healing, restful pose—useful any time a break is needed.
Gentle compression of the abdomen and chest may benefit the organs of digestion. Psychologically soothing when feeling cold, anxious or vulnerable.
Might relieve back and neck pain when the head is supported.
If the knees are fairly close together, rocking gently side to side may stimulate the flow of blood and lymph fluids in the upper chest and breast tissues.
This pose can be used as a preparation for deeper spinal flexion postures such as Straddle, Caterpillar or Snail.
This is sometimes called Balasana or Garbhasana. However, B.K.S. Iyengar has called this pose Adhomukha Virasana. He claims it can relieve headaches, dizziness, fatigue and
breathlessness, reduce high blood pressure and flatulence, and relieve menstrual pain as well as associated depression. 9 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: stressing the spine (flexion in the lumbar) and the hamstrings (tension) when the legs are straight (fig. 1). The cervical and upper thoracic spine may experience a lovely traction.
Secondary targeted areas: strengthening the quadriceps when the knees are bent (fig. 2).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Avoid if you have high blood pressure. (Poses where the head is below the heart can increase blood pressure.) Related conditions that are a problem when blood pressure is increased include diabetes and glaucoma and other eye issues. If you have these conditions, you may wish to avoid this pose and do Caterpillar instead.
If you have low blood pressure, to come out of the pose roll up to standing slowly or go into Squat to avoid dizziness.
If you have bad knees, it may be better to keep the legs straight.
If your knees are okay but you have a bad back, bend your knees a lot to allow more flexion to occur around the hips, keeping the spine more neutral. You can also rest your elbows on the thighs (fig. 3).
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow any flexion of the spine, this is not the pose for you.
This is not ideal for pregnant women, who may prefer to do a narrow version of Straddle Pose.
Contraindications from YIP: arthritis hip, gastroesophageal reflux disease, herniated lumbar disc, herniated thoracic disc, Lasik surgery, nosebleed, orthostatic hypotension, osteoporosis, plantar fasciitis, posterior total hip replacement, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), retinal tear, retrolisthesis, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, torn hamstring.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Stand up with the feet comfortably apart. Bend your knees and fold forward. You can clasp your elbows (fig. 1 and 2) or rest the elbows on the knees (fig. 3).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Another back-sparing option is to rest your elbows on a table or chair. Eventually, allow the hands to dangle to the floor.
More flexible students can clasp the elbows behind the knees with legs straight (fig. 4).
If you do this pose more than once, try it with legs bent the first time and straight the second time.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Bend your knees and release your hands to the floor. Slowly roll up. This is often called Rag Doll.
You can place your hands onto your shins and come up halfway, then fold back down. Do this a couple of times, and when you feel ready, come all the way up with as neutral a spine as possible.
If you feel dizzy or lightheaded after coming up, one option is to stay up and raise your arms overhead with knees bent a little until the dizziness passes. If that doesn’t work, fold back down and try again a breath or two later.
Another option is to come out by going directly into Squat Pose.
COUNTERPOSES
Squat is a lovely counterpose for the legs after Dangling.
This was a flexion for the spine, so spinal extension is nice. Do a gentle sitting backbend or lie on the belly. You could also do Cat’s Breath or flow into Tabletop (aka Hammock).
Seated twist is another way to release the spine.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the back side of the body may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians. Sensations through the low back may stimulate the Kidney line meridian.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three minutes can be intense; 2 minutes may be enough at one time, but the pose can be repeated. One option is to do 2 or more sessions of 2 minutes each, separated by 2 minutes of Squat.
OTHER NOTES
Balance the weight between toes and heels. You can gently sway or wobble, but avoid bouncing.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this pose Uttanasana, but in the Yin Yoga version, the emphasis is not to stretch the hamstrings a lot but rather to release the low back. If the legs are straight, it is a nice stress for the hamstrings. If the knees are bent, it is a great strengthener for the quadriceps and allows the back to release more fully. Iyengar claims it slows the heart rate, regulates blood pressure, tones the liver, spleen and kidneys, relieves abdominal and back
pain during menstruation, relieves stomach aches and headaches and cures insomnia. 10
These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: external rotation, abduction and flexion of front leg’s hip; internal rotation, abduction and flexion of back leg’s hip.
Secondary targeted areas: side of torso may twist and flex in several options.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If any knee issues exist, be careful of deep internal or external rotations of the hip. Tightness in the hip sockets tends to show up in increased stress in the knees. The more the knee is bent, however, the less stress will arise, so one option is to keep the feet in closer to the groin or buttocks, as shown in fig. 1. You could support the front knee with a bolster or folded blanket and/or sit up higher on a cushion or block.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Start by sitting in Butterfly on the floor, then swing your right leg back behind you, bringing that foot behind your hip. Position the front leg by moving the foot away from you. There is no need to move the foot more forward if the front knee is well off the floor. Move the back foot away from your hip until you start to feel like you are tipping away from that foot. If possible, keep both sitting bones firmly rooted to the ground. Sitting up on a cushion may help.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
The tendency here is to tilt away from the internally rotating hip of the back leg; make sure both sitting bones are firmly on the floor. You may need to move both feet more inwards, toward the core of the body.
If you’re very flexible and your knees don’t complain, you can begin to move your feet away from the hips (fig. 2).
To get a nice stress in the side of your torso and the back thigh, twist away from the legs (fig. 3). You can lower down to the floor and rest on your elbow(s) here, or you can rest your
chest on a bolster, which is a nice supported option for pregnant students (fig. 4).
We can deepen the flexion in the hips by folding down the middle, perhaps with the chest resting on a bolster (fig. 5).
Deer meets Swan: Another option in Deer is to fold over the front leg (fig. 6). This makes the pose into a modified version of Swan for those who tilt too much or don’t like to have their back leg straight in Swan.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Lean away from the back foot and bring that leg forward, coming back to Butterfly. You are ready to do the second side.
COUNTERPOSES
Since this is an external and internal hip rotation, the best counterpose is to do the other side.
Windshield Wipers also includes both internal and external rotations and can be done lying down, sitting up or reclining on the elbows.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
If the front leg is firmly on the floor, creating stress along the outside of the leg or hip, or if you are twisting and feel stress along the sides of the ribcage, then the Gall Bladder meridians may be stimulated. Any inner groin sensations could indicate that the Liver and Kidney meridians are stimulated. If the thigh is stressed, the Stomach and Spleen meridians may be activated.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
One to 3 minutes should be enough because most people cannot move their feet too far away to really get deep rotations in the hip sockets. The supported versions (fig. 4, 5 and 6) can be held longer, from 3 to 5 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This is a combination of Virasana (Hero Pose) for the back leg and Baddhakonasana (Butterfly) for the front leg.
Useful after long-held external hip rotations such as Shoelace, Swan or Winged Dragon.
Most students won’t easily understand what the pose is about; they won’t move their feet far enough away from the groin or hips, or they will tilt too much, allowing the internally
rotated hip to rise off the floor. Teachers will have to inspect their students and offer guidance to ensure sensations are felt in the targeted areas.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the quadriceps and hip flexors of the back leg (tension), hip socket of the front leg (flexion but also external rotation and abduction in some options).
Secondary targeted areas: some options provide minor flexion, extension or twisting of the spine. One option also works into the ankle (dorsiflexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Can be uncomfortable for the kneecap or ankle of the straight leg. There are several options to reduce kneecap pain: pad the back of the knee with a blanket; place support under the shin, allowing the knee to be off the floor (fig. 1); or keep the knee bent with the foot raised off the floor (fig. 7). 11 If the ankle is uncomfortable, place a blanket underneath it or lift the leg by putting support under the shin.
Due to asymmetric stresses in the sacroiliac joints, pregnant women may wish to avoid these poses, or not go so low (fig. 2 and 5).
If you experience discomfort or a painful pinching at the front hip (from compression into the thigh), point the toes and knee outward, allowing you to go around that point of compression.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Begin either on hands and knees or in Down Dog. Step one foot between the hands. Walk the front foot forward until the knee is over the heel. Slide the back knee backward as far as you can. Keep the hands on either side of the front foot. This first version of the pose is a simple low lunge called Baby Dragon (fig. 1). To help you easily reach the floor, you can rest your hands on blocks.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
For the High-Flying Dragon, rest the arms or hands on the front thigh and lift the chest. Alternately, you can rest one or both hands on a block or two (fig. 2). Having the chest higher increases the stress in the front hip. Make sure you don’t move your hips backward, which reduces the desired stress in the hips and quadriceps and may increase stress on the back knee.
For the Low-Flying Dragon (fig. 3), place both hands inside the front foot, move the foot a few inches toward the edge of the mat (so you are no longer blocked by the front thigh) and walk hands forward, lowering the hips. For more depth, come down on the elbows or rest them on a bolster or block.
In Twisted Dragon (fig. 4), one hand holds the front knee, while the chest rotates to the sky.
In Winged Dragon (fig. 5), with hands on the floor, wing out the knee a few times, rolling onto the outside edge of that foot, and then stay there with the knee low. You could come down on the elbows or rest them on a block or bolster.
For the Fire-Breathing Dragon (fig. 6), in any of the above variations, tuck the back toe under and lift the knee off the floor, lengthening the leg. This puts more weight into the hips, increasing the stress. This is much more yang-like, so don’t hold this position too long.
Overstepping Dragon (fig. 7) stresses the ankle. From Baby Dragon, allow the front knee to come far forward and/or slide the heel backward until the heel is just about to lift off the ground. The sensations we are seeking are at the back of the front leg’s calf (tension) or the front of the ankle (compression). It helps to allow the back leg to come forward a lot.
Dragon Splits offers the deepest stress in the hip flexors. Straighten both legs into the splits. Support the front hip with a block or bolster under the buttock for balance and to release weight; this relaxes the muscles. Sit up tall (fig. 8) or fold forward (fig. 9) for different sensations.
Bowing Dragon (fig. 10) is a half-splits version. Keep the front leg straight while moving the hips backward. Fold forward over the front leg. Feel the hamstrings. Another version (fig. 11) is to sit on the floor beside the back foot, which makes this pose into a version of Half Saddle.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Move your paws to Down Dog position, move the back knee forward a bit, tuck the back toes under, and with a nice groan, step back to Down Dog. Many students may prefer to go straight to Child’s Pose.
COUNTERPOSES
A short Down Dog is delicious. Bend one knee, lifting that heel and pushing the opposite heel down, and then switch sides repeatedly (this is called Walking the Dog).
Child’s Pose feels really good after Down Dog and before switching to the other side of the Dragon.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
This is one posture than can stimulate all 6 lower body meridians! Sensations along the top of the back leg may indicate that the Stomach and Spleen meridians are being stimulated. Sensation in the inner groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians. Sensations along the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians. Sensations along the sides of the ribs (in the Twisting Dragon) or outside of the hips may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridian.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Hold each variation for 1 to 2 minutes and cycle through 2 or 3 variations. Or hold just 1 variation for 3 to 5 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This is sometimes referred to as the low lunge (Anjaneyasana).
You may not feel anything in the outer hip joint. If your hip flexors or quadriceps are tight, these areas will take all the stress. This is still a good pose, but to work your hips, other poses will be needed.
B.K.S. Iyengar claims that Dragon Splits (which he calls Hanumanasana) can cure sciatica. 12
This claim has not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the inner groin (adductors—tension) and hip sockets (flexion and adduction).
Secondary targeted areas: the spine may experience extension (backbend) stresses in less flexible students or when the hips remain high; the hips may externally rotate if the feet are together or internally rotate if the feet are wider than the knees.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you have a bad back, compression in the low back may be too much. If the knees complain, use padding underneath them.
If the neck complains when you try to look forward, try resting the forehead on the floor, not the chin, or place a bolster under the chest.
If you are prone to tingling in the hands or discomfort in the shoulders when you extend the arms overhead, you may need to move the hands wider apart or closer together. If that doesn’t help, do one arm at a time.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
To begin, start in Child’s Pose and slide both hands forward, separate the knees, but remain sitting on the heels. This is also known as the Tadpole (fig. 2).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Half Frog (fig. 1): Move the hips forward until they are in line with the knees. Keep feet together. It is okay to allow the hips to be high, at least at first. Eventually, the knees widen and the hips may lower.
Full Frog (fig. 3): Try separating the feet wider apart. If knees complain, don’t!
For students with shoulder issues or tingling in the hands, reach only one arm forward at a time (fig. 4). The other arm can be bent with the head resting on that forearm. Alternately, experiment with hand positions (closer or further apart).
If stress in the groin or hips is too severe, allow the hips to come forward of the knees (fig. 5) or keep the toes together and allow the hips to be behind the knees (fig. 2).
To reduce the amount of backbend and support the upper body, rest the chest on a bolster (fig. 5). Pregnant students may prefer this option, or to rest onto their elbows (fig. 6).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Either bring the knees together coming onto your forearms and then sit back into Child’s Pose, or slide forward onto your belly, bringing your legs together.
COUNTERPOSES
Child’s Pose.
Lying down Windshield Wipers to adduct and internally rotate the legs at the hips.
Lying on your back, hug your knees to your chest and rock side to side or move the knees in circles.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensation along the front of the belly may stimulate the Spleen and Stomach meridians. Sensation through the inner groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
Sensation along the spine, especially in the low back, may stimulate the Kidney and Urinary Bladder meridians.
The arms stretched forward may stimulate the Heart, Lungs, and Small and Large Intestines meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This is also called Mandukasana or Bhekasana.
When the hips are in line with the knees, gravity has maximum effect. However, often students will move hips forward to avoid painful compression in the hips—that is okay. Allowing the hips to move a bit may move the stress from the hips and low back to the inner thighs.
If the knees are kept together, this becomes Anahatasana (Melting Heart Pose)!
If doing this right after eating, rest on the elbows and don’t let the abdomen rest on the floor.
Allow it to hang, which is nice for digestion.
To advance in this posture, don’t go deeper, stay longer! But don’t go overboard; 5 minutes of being a frog should be enough for most princes.
You could do the first half of the pose in Tadpole and then move to Full Frog for the second half.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: abduction, flexion and possibly external rotation in the hip sockets.
Secondary targeted areas: can create flexion stress in the low back and tension in the hamstrings and adductor muscles.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If the hips roll up off the floor, this can become a mild inversion and a mild flexion of the spine. If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: keep the back as neutral as you can. Do not allow the hips to roll off the floor.
Women during menstruation may also choose not to allow their hips to roll off the floor.
This is not ideal for pregnant women, who may prefer to do Squat, Child’s Pose or Frog instead.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Lying on your back, hug the knees to your chest. Grab the soles of the feet, the ankles or the back of the legs. Move the feet apart so they are above the knees, and pull the knees toward the
floor, alongside your chest (fig. 1). Relax your head and shoulders down to the floor.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
If the feet are too far away, hold the backs of the thighs (fig. 2) or use belts or straps to hold the feet.
Half Happy Baby (like an upside-down Baby Dragon), holding one foot at a time (fig. 3). The free leg can be either straight along the floor, or bend the knee and rest the foot on the floor.
After a few minutes of active pulling with the arms, relax and let the weight of the arms and legs draw the knees down to the floor.
Another easy alternative is to do this against a wall, called the Wall Squat (fig. 4).
The Happy Baby Butterfly version can be a good starting option. Keep your feet together for an initial stage, holding them near the groin (fig. 5); for a deeper version, bring the toes to
your nose like babies can do. Eventually, feet go behind the head! (Eventually, but not necessarily in this lifetime.)
One option to create more stress in the hamstrings, adductors and hips is to gradually straighten the legs while still pulling the feet down and wider apart (fig. 6). In this option, do not allow your hips to lift off the floor.
If you feel you have had enough but other students want to stay longer, come into a reclining Butterfly (feet together, knees bent, feet on the floor) and wait there for everyone else to come out. Reclining Butterfly can be very juicy too!
Where should the hips be? There are two schools of thought:
   * Allow the tailbone to curve up in the air. This creates more flexion in the spine.
   * Keep the tailbone low to the ground. This reduces spinal flexion but may increase stress in the legs and hips. Which one works better for you? What is your intention?
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Release the feet, placing them on the floor, with the knees bent. Walk the feet away from each other, keeping the knees together. Pause for a moment.
COUNTERPOSES
Gentle backbends (lying on abdomen) or, while on the back, a mild spinal lift, coming up only halfway.
Windshield Wipers moves the hips into both external and internal rotations. Lying down with your knees bent and your feet on the floor as wide apart as the mat, drop the knees from side to side.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the back of the legs or along the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
Sensations along the inner groin (adductors) may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Two minutes if you are actively pulling with the arms, but if you relax the arms, you can linger up to 5 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This pose is sometimes called Ananda Balasana but is also known as Window Pose, and in Los Angeles as Dead Bug Pose. Sarah Powers call this Stirrup Pose.
This is one of the few postures in yoga where one can strengthen the bicep muscles in the arms if you use the hands rather than gravity to pull the feet or legs down.
It can be a nice preparation posture for Squats or deep external hip rotation poses.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: rotation along the spine and torso.
Secondary targeted areas: can create tension along the outer hip and the legs and in the arms and shoulders.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Students with back issues may find too much stress along the spine.
Similarly, students with instability in the sacroiliac (SI) joints may want to pin the hips first and move from the shoulders, which can reduce stress in the pelvic area (fig. 3).
For shoulder issues (such as rotator cuff injuries) or if tingling arises in the hands when the arms are out to the side or overhead, don’t raise your arms. Instead, lower the arms or support them with bolsters or blankets. If tingling persists, rest the hands on the chest. Do not tolerate tingling, because this could be a sign that you are damaging a nerve.
Contraindications from YIP: gastroesophageal reflux disease, herniated lumbar disc, herniated thoracic disc, posterior total hip replacement, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, torn hamstring, trochanteric bursitis.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
To initiate the twist from the hips, pin the shoulders first: lying on your back, draw one or both knees into your chest. Open your arms to the side like wings and then drop the knee(s) to one side (fig. 2). This may generate more stress in the lower spine and pelvis than in the upper spine.
To initiate the twist from the shoulders, pin the hips first: lying on your back, draw the knees into the chest and roll over onto your side (in a fetal-like position). Keep the knees on the ground, raise the top arm up in the air and allow gravity to draw it to the floor behind you (fig. 3). This may generate more stress in the upper spine than the lower spine and pelvis.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Directing the knees lower or higher may affect where in the spine the stress is felt. If the knees are higher (fig. 4), stress may be more obvious in the upper back, which is more flexed/rounded; lowering the knees (fig. 5) may make the stress more obvious in the low back, which is more extended.
For the deeper one-knee twist, draw one knee into the chest and, holding that knee with the opposite hand, draw it across the body (fig. 1).
For the Twisted Roots option (fig. 6), cross the legs as in Eagle Pose (Garudasana) and if available, hook the toes under the opposite calf. Dropping the knees to the opposite side of the top leg creates the greatest spinal twist, but going to the same side as the top leg (called the Twisted-Twisted Roots Pose) may create more stress along the outside of the hips. It is more challenging to keep the foot hooked in this latter position.
If a shoulder is floating uncomfortably, place a blanket under it or a bolster under the bent knee(s).
Experiment with turning your head to either side and notice how the sensations change. If lightheadedness or dizziness arises, do not keep the head turned.
The extended arms can be resting on the floor or on a bolster if the stress of floating is too much.
If the legs are floating, place support under the legs or between them (fig. 9).
Sandbags on the top thigh or shoulders may help you stay in the pose or may create more stress in the targeted areas (fig. 1 and 9).
Placing the top leg straight out to the side applies the most leverage, which helps to keep the hips fully turned. For some, it’s less of a twist and more stress in the outside of the leg and hip; this can be great for the iliotibial band. The deepest version of this option is to hold the
foot with the opposite hand (fig. 7), which may increase stress along the hamstrings as well. Another option is to also hold the bottom foot and pull it away, much like the Cat Pulling Its Tail Pose (fig. 8).
For students who feel they are rolling out of the twist (usually larger-bodied students), a bolster placed along the spine may be supportive and keep them in the pose (fig. 9).
For pregnant women who prefer not to lie on their backs, seated twists or the folding forward version of Deer Pose (fig. 10) may be a better option.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Slowly roll onto your back and hug the knees into the chest to release the sacrum and lumbar. (Don’t forget to do the other side.)
COUNTERPOSES
Hug the knees and rock on your back from side to side.
Windshield Wipers while lying back can be a nice release. Lying down with your knees bent and your feet on the floor as wide apart as the mat, drop the knees from side to side.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the sides of the ribcage or the outside of the hips may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
Sensations along the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
One or both arms overhead may stimulate the Heart, Lung, Small Intestines and Large Intestines meridians.
Twists can physically compress the abdomen and massage the internal organs.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes.
As a teacher, this a nice “contingency posture” to end the class with: you can shorten the amount of time spent in the twist if the class is overrunning the clock, or you can lengthen the amount of time the students marinate in the pose if you have extra time left in the class.
OTHER NOTES
Another name for this pose is Jatharaparivartanasana. It is much easier to say “Reclining Twist.”
An excellent final pose of the practice because it removes kinks and tension along the spine.
You can slide right from this pose into Shavasana.
Twisted Roots is a great way to internally rotate the hips after a lot of external hip rotation work, such as Shoelace, Swan, Square or Winged Dragon poses.
Don’t force the twist; relax and let gravity do the work.
When the twist is initiated from the upper body first (with hips pinned), more stress may be generated in the shoulders and upper spine.
When the twist is initiated from the lower body first (with shoulders pinned), more stress may be generated in the lower spine, hips and SI joints. 13
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: extension along the spine and counternutation in the sacroiliac joints. Secondary targeted areas: Many! This pose can create stress in the ankles (dorsiflexion) and knees (flexion), tension in the hip flexors (quadriceps, iliacus and psoas), sacroiliac joints (SIJ—counternutation) and lumbar (extension), and tension in the lower belly if the arms are raised overhead, which may also stress the shoulders. If sitting between the feet, internal
rotation happens in the hip sockets.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you have a bad back or tight SI joints, choose another pose.
Knees can be tested too much here, in which case, sit higher on more support. Ankles can protest, in which case, place padding (blankets or towels) under them.
Tingling may arise in the hands if the arms are overhead, in which case, lower the arms. If any sharp or burning pain occurs anywhere, you must come out of the pose!
Pregnant women may like this pose, but they probably won’t go all the way to the floor and will rest on an angled bolster (fig. 4).
Contraindications from YIP: anterior cruciate ligament tear, arthritis hip, arthritis knee, arthritis shoulder, chondromalacia patellae, gastroesophageal reflux disease, lateral meniscal
tear, lumbar spinal stenosis, medial meniscal tear, posterior cruciate ligament tear, posterior total hip replacement, sacroiliac joint derangement, sprained ankle, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
There are several options for coming into this pose. Start with sitting on the heels and noticing how this feels. If there’s pain in the knees, sit higher on cushions or skip this pose and choose another one that works your primary targeted area. If your ankles are complaining, try a blanket under them or skip the pose. Lean back on your hands, creating a little arch in the low back (fig. 2). Check in with how this feels. This may be it for you today! If you can go further, come down onto your elbows. If that is easy, lie down all the way to the floor (fig. 1).
Some students find this pose challenging not because they cannot do the pose but because they cannot get into the pose from sitting on their heels. 14 For these students it is better to come into the pose from Windshield Wipers (fig. 9): lying on your back, bend your knees with the feet on the floor but as wide apart as possible (as wide as or wider than the mat) and drop both knees to one side; now you are in a version of Half Saddle! To make it deeper, pull the foot close to your hip even higher and move that knee wider, past the edge of the mat.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
If this is too deep for any of the many reasons cited above, choose Sphinx Pose, which also affects the main targeted area.
Play with sitting on the heels and between the heels; the first emphasizes the lumbar extension, and the second works the quads and hip flexors more. Lifting the hips higher by placing a block between the feet and under the buttocks increases extension in the spine.
Resting the top of the head on the floor opens the throat, but it may be too much of a deep neck extension.
Arms overhead can open the shoulders and intensify the stress in the hip flexors. If tingling arises, try resting the arms on your forehead or a bolster. If that doesn’t resolve the tingling, lower your arms.
If you can only go as far back as your elbows, rest on a bolster to relax here (fig. 3). There are various ways you may use bolsters—crossways under the shoulders or lengthwise under the spine. If you can’t quite rest on the bolster, try making a higher wedge out of it by placing blocks under the end of it (fig. 4).
For many students, it is better to do one leg at a time, called Half Saddle. There are many versions. You can straighten one leg, keeping one knee bent (fig. 5), or you can bend the straight leg and place the foot on the floor (fig. 6). Alternatively, that bent leg’s foot can rest on a block or against a wall. A deeper variation is to hug the top knee toward the chest (fig. 7). That can get quite juicy, but if you want even more juice, straighten that leg up in the air and hold it with your hands or a strap.
For the King Arthur version of Half Saddle (fig. 8), come to a wall and have the targeted leg’s knee at the corner of the wall and floor, with its shin up against the wall and the other foot on the floor. Work over time to get your back against the wall. Initially, you can have your hands on the floor or on blocks for balance, but eventually, the arms may be raised up against the wall.
If the targeted area is your upper thigh (quadriceps stretch), a side-lying thigh stretch may be a good alternative. Lying on your side, reach down and grab the top foot (or use a strap) and pull it away from your pelvis.
An exotic version of Half Saddle uses wide stairs (fig. 10). Lying on a middle stair, allow your bent leg to rest on the lower stair.
It is possible to add a side bend if you can lie all the way down, called Banana in the Saddle (fig. 11). Sitting between the feet, if possible, clasp your elbows overhead and arch your upper body far to one side.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
There are several ways to end this pose. One option is to come back up the way you went down, propping yourself up on your elbows and then onto the hands. Then lie down on your belly, straightening your legs slowly to allow the knees to release.
If that doesn’t work or you are stuck, rent a crane, hire a forklift or call for help. If they are not available, trying rolling to one side and slowly straighten the opposite leg. Before rolling onto your back, you may want to wait a bit or hold your sacrum with your free hand and ease down to your back.
If you’re flexible, you can just lift both knees up and pop your feet out, or free one leg at a time.
COUNTERPOSES
After coming out, lie quietly on your back for a few breaths with the legs straight, tightening and releasing the kneecaps. When you are ready, hug the backs of the thighs and pull the knees to the chest to release the low back.
Child’s Pose: Move into it slowly. You may need to rest your head on your palms before coming into a full Child’s Pose.
Plank on elbows (Crocodile) engages the knees and tones the core of the body. Windshield Wipers works well for many students.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the top of the thighs and through the belly may stimulate the Stomach and Spleen meridians.
Sensations along the spine, especially the low back, may stimulate the Kidney and Urinary Bladder meridians.
If your arms are overhead, you may also stimulate the Heart and Lung meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
One to 5 minutes.
Iyengar says up to 15 minutes! 15
OTHER NOTES
This is not a deep backbend for experienced yogis who are already very open in the low back; however, this pose does work many areas at once: ankles, knees, quadriceps, iliacus, psoas, sacrum, lumbar and shoulders.
There is space for the belly to expand, so this pose can be done soon after eating, and many pregnant women like this pose when they are supported on a bolster.
If your job requires you to stand all day and you do this pose at night before bed, your legs may feel rested in the morning.
Tucking the tailbone (posterior tilt of the pelvis) may increase sensations in the hip flexors, but it decreases extension in the spine. Anterior tilting of the pelvis deepens the backbend extension but reduces stress in the hip flexors. Which option you choose to do depends upon your intention for the pose.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this pose Supta Virasana and, as mentioned, suggests it should be held for as long as you can, even up to 10–15 minutes! This shows that the Yin Yoga style is not new, even though he never uses this terminology. Holding postures for a long time has been around since the beginning of Hatha Yoga. He also claims it massages the heart and thereby improves blood flow, improves resistance to infections, relieves indigestion and flatulence, corrects a prolapsed uterus and flat feet, reduces menstrual and ovarian disorders, and reduces pain in the feet, legs and knees. 16 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the hips (flexion, external rotation, adduction).
Secondary targeted areas: when folding forward the whole spine (flexion); for the Half Shoelace, tension in the hamstrings (due to hip flexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Many knees do not like this pose because of the external rotation at the hips. If your knees complain, raise the knees higher with supports (fig. 2) or try another option. If knee pain persists in all variations, skip this pose.
Can aggravate sciatica. If you have piriformis sciatica, elevate the hips by sitting on a cushion so the knees are below the hips (reducing hip flexion). If you have discogenic sciatica, avoid rounding forward (reducing spinal flexion). In either case, if symptoms are made worse, avoid this pose entirely.
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: stay sitting up and keep the back as neutral as you can.
Pregnant women will probably not be able to fold forward after the first trimester. They may also prefer to twist away from the top leg (fig. 5) or side-bend away from the top leg (fig. 7). Another option for pregnant students is the Sitting Swan (Eye-of-the-Needle) pose (fig. 11).
Contraindications from YIP: anterior cruciate ligament tear, arthritis hip, arthritis knee, ischial bursitis, posterior total hip replacement, sprained ankle, torn abductors, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
There are several options for coming into this pose. One method is to begin by sitting on your heels, slide onto one buttock and bring the opposite foot toward its opposite hip. A second approach is to begin by sitting cross-legged and then draw one foot under the opposite thigh and the other foot over toward its opposite hip.
A riskier approach (for the knees) is to begin by kneeling on all fours, then placing one knee behind the other and sitting back between the heels. (For some students, this approach involves a free-fall into sitting, and if their hips are not sufficiently open, too much stress can suddenly be placed onto the knees.)
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
If this is not available due to pain or discomfort, sit cross-legged and fold forward.
Try not to sit on the feet, but slide them as far forward as they can go, anchoring both sitting bones to the ground (fig. 1).
If hips are tight, sit on a bolster to reduce the amount of hip flexion occurring. However, more flexible students may prefer to sit on the floor, increasing hip flexion, which may paradoxically reduce stress in the knees. 17
If the bottom knee complains, place a prop under the bottom knee (fig. 2) or do the pose with the bottom leg straight. This is the Half Saddle (fig. 3). Folding forward now makes the hamstrings feel really juicy.
If the top knee complains, place a bolster or blanket under that knee or slide its foot more forward, increasing flexion at that hip. Some students may need to prop both knees (fig. 2). Folding forward over the legs (fig. 4) increases flexion in the hips and spine. If this is too challenging, support the chest on a bolster or rest the head in your hands. The further forward you fold, the more you can externally rotate the hips, and thus you may be able to
move the feet further apart. Sensations may also increase in the buttocks.
If you choose to remain sitting upright, your hands can be to your side or you can stretch the arms back behind the body and add a backbend (spinal extension). This may create more stress in the knees, however.
Twists, side bends or Eagle Arms can be added. For the side bends, bending to the side of the top leg may feel more stable (fig. 6) but some people prefer bending away from the top leg (fig. 7). Similarly, you can twist toward the top knee (fig. 2), which pins the hips more, or twist away from it, which compresses the belly less (fig. 5). While in Eagle Arms, you may add a forward fold (fig. 8).
Many students love to do this pose lying down: a reclining Shoelace, holding the feet of the crossed legs (fig. 9).
Other alternatives include Eye-of-the-Needle Pose, either lying down (fig. 10) or sitting (fig.
11), Square Pose or Swan.
Very flexible students can bring their feet more forward, until their shins are parallel to the front of their mat, with their knees still on top of each other. This in effect makes the pose into a version of Square Pose.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Lean back to release the hips, and slowly straighten the legs. (Don’t forget to do the other side.)
COUNTERPOSES
Windshield Wipers lying down or sitting (to provide an internal rotation of the hip).
Deer Pose (which again provides internal rotation at the back hip). Tabletop (aka Hammock) to release the spine.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the outside of the hips may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
Sensations through the inner knees, thighs and groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the spine or the back of the legs may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
Variations that include upper-body stresses through the arms and shoulders may stimulate the Heart and Lung meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes per side.
OTHER NOTES
This pose is also known as Cowface (Gomukhasana); if you can see a cow here, you have a good imagination!
It is nice to follow this with Swan or Sleeping Swan before doing the other side. Start with the more open hip (whichever hip is more open, place that knee on top).
Keep your weight back into the sitting bones when you come forward, preventing the weight from moving into the knees.
Keep the hips even. There is a tendency for the top hip to be pulled forward.
While you are lingering in this pose, try some poses targeting the shoulders or wrists. Check the upcoming section on the upper body for some suggestions.
You could do the first half of the time in a variation like side bend or twist and then fold forward for the remaining time.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the whole length of the spine (flexion). Secondary targeted areas: can create tension in the hamstrings.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
This pose may put a lot of pressure on the neck, so be cautious! Avoid if you have any neck problems.
Not recommended for anyone with high blood pressure, upper-body infection, vertigo, glaucoma or a cold. Women who are menstruating may also find it better not to do this pose.
If you have any low back disorder that does not allow flexion of the spine, this may not be a great pose for you.
Do not do this posture if you have recently eaten or are pregnant.
Contraindications from YIP: arthritis hip, congestive heart failure, coronary arterial disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, glaucoma, herniated lumbar disc, Lasik surgery, menstruation, nosebleed, osteoporosis, posterior total hip replacement, retinal tear, retrolisthesis, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, torn hamstring.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Lie down, lift your hips and support them with your hands. Allow your back to round (unlike the Plough Pose, Halasana, in which we strive to keep the spine and legs straight). Let your feet fall over your head toward the floor (fig. 1). Position the weight of your body onto your shoulders; note how much weight is on your neck—some is okay, but not too much!
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
For beginners or those not wishing to invert, replace this pose with a seated straight leg, a forward fold (such as Caterpillar) or a legs-up-the-wall pose.
An option for less flexible students is the mini version of Snail, with the hips lifted just enough for them to rest on bolsters (fig. 2).
There are many variations that can increase stress:
   * Support the back with the palms (fig. 1).
   * More challenging is to place the palms under the feet and lower the feet to the floor, or rest the feet on a bolster (fig. 3) or a chair, or even press them against a wall.
   * Deeper is to have the legs straight and feet on the floor (fig. 4). However, this version has less rounding of the spine, more flexion in the hips and more stress in the hamstrings. It may also create the deepest flexion of the neck, so blankets under the shoulders may be required.
   * Most challenging is to bend the knees toward the floor (fig. 5), which may create the deepest stress along the spine.
Unlike in Plough Pose (Halasana), we want the spine to round. A deeper stress in the mid and upper back may be created if you back off from the desire to have your feet on the floor and hips over the head. Instead, move your hips back, as shown in fig. 6. Hips can be supported in the hands, on bolsters or even against a wall. This position may be better for the neck, as there is much less neck flexion occurring now.
If the legs are straight and the feet are touching the floor, the hands can come to the floor behind the back. Your hands can be apart (easier) or together (if there are no shoulder problems), but be careful; bringing the hands together can aggravate rotator cuff problems. This is more like the classical Plough Pose (fig. 7).
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
The simplest way to come out is to keep the knees bent and hold your hips, allowing yourself to slowly roll down. Your head will likely lift up as you come down and that is okay.
More challenging is to come out with the legs straight and holding the feet. Slowly roll down, holding the feet as a way to slow your descent.
COUNTERPOSES
After coming out, lie down for a few breaths with the knees bent and feet on the floor.
Do Windshield Wipers, then a gentle backbend, such as by lying on the abdomen, or a mild spinal lift. Come up only halfway.
Upward Facing Cat. Child’s Pose.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the spine and back of the legs may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians. The internal organs are physically compressed, and each breath adds to the massage.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 5 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
This is a very deep flexion for the spine, so it is not a pose to start your practice with. First prepare the spine with gentler flexions, such as Butterfly or Caterpillar.
Indeed, many students do not need to do this pose at all and can simply linger longer in Caterpillar. However, for more flexible students who do not feel much in the easier postures, Snail may be perfect. Even so, don’t start with Snail. Spend a couple of minutes in Caterpillar and then roll onto your back for Snail.
Allow the spine to fully round. Unlike Halasana, do not try to keep the spine straight.
B.K.S. Iyengar claims Halasana controls blood pressure, improves digestion, can assist with treating hemorrhoids, reduces fatigue, insomnia and anxiety, alleviates symptoms of asthma, bronchitis and congestion, relieves heart palpitations and breathlessness, and improves the function of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. 18 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: the sacral-lumbar spine (compression). Secondary targeted areas: the front torso (tension).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If you have low back problems or sacral instabilities, this pose may not be for you. If any sharp pains arise, you must come out!
Avoid lifting the head in Sphinx if you have a headache or if it causes a headache.
Contraindications from YIP: anterior total hip replacement, anterolisthesis, carpal tunnel syndrome (Seal), cervical spinal stenosis, Dupuytren’s contracture, facet syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, tennis elbow (Seal).
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Lie down on your belly. Move the elbows just ahead of your shoulders, propping yourself up (fig. 1). Notice how this feels in your low back. If the sensations are too strong, move your elbows further ahead, lowering your chest closer to the floor. Even lying flat on the floor may be enough stress for the low back (fig. 2).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Hands can hold the elbows (fig. 3), be clasped together or be flat on the floor.
If your head gets too heavy for your neck, try resting your head in your hands or on a block (fig. 3), or your chin on your fists.
If there is too much discomfort in the shoulders or upper chest, try a bolster or two under the armpits (fig. 4).
If after a few minutes in the pose there is not enough stress in the low back, try bending the knees (fig. 4) and/or propping the elbows higher on blocks (fig. 5).
How far apart the knees should be is variable. Which position feels best for you? (Where do you get the appropriate amount of stress in the targeted areas?)
If the stress in the low back is still not enough, Seal Pose may be required. To come into Seal, turn your hands outward, straighten the arms (locking the elbows) and walk the hands toward you (fig. 6). It is okay if the elbows hyperextend here, because they are not bearing much weight. Indeed, this may be a good time to stress the elbow joints.
You may feel the greatest amount of compression in the low back in Seal Pose if your hands are not right under the shoulders but slightly forward.
Rather than coming into Seal with the arms in front, have the hands and arms straight out to the side, and walk them in toward you. 19
You can place a bolster or blanket under the pubic bone or thighs to reduce uncomfortable pressure (fig. 5 and 7).
Pregnant women may enjoy this pose if they place a bolster under both the thighs and elbows; there is no pressure at all in the belly (fig. 8).
Tightening the buttocks is okay within reason. Sagging the shoulders is also okay. These actions will not affect the stress in the targeted areas.
To arch the neck and stimulate the cervical spine, lengthen the neck, drop the head back, lift the chin and open the throat. This is for Seal only; it is not a good idea to do this in Sphinx, as it involves too much neck extension, which can cause headaches or lightheadedness.
If you’re very flexible, try these postures with the legs in Lotus.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
To come out, slowly lower your chest to the floor. Turn your head to one side and rest your cheek on your palms. You may wish to decompress the low back more by sliding one knee alongside you on the floor.
COUNTERPOSES
Child’s Pose is a nice, gentle forward fold; move into it slowly. You may need to rest your head on your palms.
On your way to Child’s Pose, you may crave Cat’s Breath: flow from the Upward Facing Cat to the Downward Facing Cat (aka Cat/Cow) but flow gently, in time with the breath. Don’t make these your deepest Cats ever.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the spine and low back may stimulate the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the front of the body may stimulate the Stomach and Spleen meridians. There is a physical compression of the kidneys as well.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Sphinx can be held for a long time: 5–10 minutes for most people. Or do the pose twice with each set lasting 3–5 minutes.
For Seal, start with one-minute holds, come down, rest, and repeat 2–3 times. Eventually Seal can be held for 5 minutes or more.
Eventually Sphinx can be held up to 20 minutes!
OTHER NOTES
If tingling arises in the hands in Seal Pose, this is not good. Probably nerves are being compressed or blood flow is restricted. Come back to Sphinx.
Seal Pose is a deeper backbend than Saddle and thus can be done after Saddle. Sphinx, however, is not as deep as Saddle, so it may be done before Saddle.
This is a great pose for watching television or reading on the floor. People with bulging or herniated discs may find this very therapeutic. 20
According to Daoists, between the L2 and L3 vertebrae is found the “Door of Life,” where jing energy is housed. You may feel a lot of stress right there.
In Seal, if the neck is dropped back, the thyroid and parathyroid glands may be physically stimulated.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this Bhujangasana (Cobra), but his version requires a lot of muscular
engagement. He claims it is a panacea for injured spines. verified.

INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the hips (flexion and external rotation).
Secondary targeted areas: when folding forward, the whole spine (flexion).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Watch the pressure on the knees; if the hips are too tight, the stress will go to the knees. If you feel any pain or burning sensations in the knees, modify the pose or skip it.
This pose can aggravate sciatica. If you have piriformis sciatica, elevate the hips by sitting on a cushion so the knees are below the hips (reducing hip flexion). If you have discogenic sciatica, avoid rounding forward (reducing spinal flexion). In either case, if symptoms are made worse, avoid this pose entirely.
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: keep the back as neutral as you can.
Pregnant women should be okay doing this pose, but skip the folding forward options.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
This can be a tricky one to get into. The key is to go where you feel some juiciness in the outer hips, never in the knees. Start by sitting with legs crossed. Move your feet forward until your shins are parallel to the front edge of your mat (your legs are “square” to it). (Notice which leg is in front because when you do the other side, you will want to bring the other leg in front.)
Try to move your knees closer together without allowing your feet to come back closer to you (fig. 1).
Ideally, the thighs are parallel to each other and the shins are parallel to each other. But who cares about ideals! That alignment is not available to every body, so do what works for you.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
If this is not available due to pain or discomfort, try sitting cross-legged and folding forward. Folding forward stretches the low back and can intensify the stress in the buttocks (fig. 2).
However, folding forward (deepening the hip flexion) may reduce stress in the knees,
allowing you to move your feet further away from you or to stack the legs on top of each other.
If you’re tight or experience discomfort in the knees, or if the knees are high off the floor, you can place blankets or some form of support under the knees (fig. 3).
If you can’t come forward, sit higher on cushions. It is also okay to support the upper body with a bolster (fig. 4) and/or rest your head in your hands or on a block.
If you crave a little more stress, a sandbag along the spine may be delicious (fig. 4).
If you remain sitting up, you can add twists, side bends and other arm/shoulder work.
A deeper option is to place the front leg on a bolster (fig. 5) or come into the version of the pose where one ankle is over the opposite knee and the other ankle under its opposite knee (fig. 6). If the top knee is very high in the air, you are not ready for this variation! Bring that foot to the floor in front of its opposite knee.
If you’re very flexible, try to slide the knees closer together, allowing the feet to go further apart (fig. 7). This is where Square meets the deeper version of Shoelace.
If none of these options works for you, other alternatives for working into the hips include Eye-of-the-Needle, Shoelace, Butterfly and Swan.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Lean back and slowly straighten the legs out in front of you. Remember to do both sides!
COUNTERPOSES
Bounce out the legs and tighten/release the knees a few times.
This was a fairly deep external rotation of the hips, so we want to move the hips in the opposite direction. Some nice internal rotations of the hips are Deer or Windshield Wipers.
If you’re craving a backbend, perform Tabletop or lie down and do some Spinal Lifts.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations along the outside of the hips may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
Sensations through the inner knees, thighs and groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the spine or the back of the legs may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME : Three to 5 minutes per side.
OTHER NOTES
If you’re a beginner, you may tend to bring your feet very close to the groin. That may be okay! Even a simple cross-legged sitting posture may be enough for your body. If you are feeling it, you are doing it! Be there and enjoy.
Square Pose is in the middle of a continuum between Butterfly (legs abducted) and Shoelace (legs adducted). All 3 postures include external rotation and flexion at the hips. If one of these poses doesn’t work for you, the others might.
Other names for Square are Double Pigeon, Boxcar, 90-90 and Fire Log.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls cross-legged sitting (the easy version of Square Pose) Swastikasana. He claims it rests tired legs and feet, reduces inflammation in the knees and the veins of the legs, strengthens knee cartilage and makes the hips supple. 22 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: dorsiflexion of ankles, flexion of knees and hips.
Secondary targeted areas: flexion of the lumbar spine can feel like a decompression; for some students, those with feet wider apart, this also creates abduction and a little bit of external rotation in the hip sockets.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If hips are too tight, this might overly stress the knees.
If you have knee issues and cannot fully flex your knees, avoid this pose.
For students with tight ankles who have to have their heels in the air, so be it! Just because your ankles are tight doesn’t mean you can’t do this pose.
Contraindications from YIP: anterior cruciate ligament tear, arthritis hip, arthritis knee, chondromalacia patellae, herniated thoracic disc, medial meniscal tear, orthostatic hypotension, osteoporosis, plantar fasciitis, posterior cruciate ligament tear, posterior total hip replacement, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), sprained ankle, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Start by standing with the feet hip-width apart, feet turned slightly outward. Squat down with your arms in front of you for counterbalance (fig. 1). When all the way down, your hands can be in prayer, with the elbows pulling lightly against the knees or shins.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Many students cannot easily do this posture due to tightness in the hips, knees and/or ankles. If your heels are off the floor, there are several options to try: use a folded blanket or bolster under the heels (fig. 2); widen the distance between the feet; or turn the feet more outward (fig. 3).
Find the place where you can relax in this pose. But if that is not going to happen at all, try the Wall Squat or Happy Baby, which are similarly shaped postures. Child’s Pose with legs apart also shares similar movements at the joints (except the ankles) with less stress.
In a classroom setting, if the pose gets tiring, switch to Butterfly while everyone else remains in Squat.
When the feet are wide apart (hip width or more), you may feel more stress in the hips.
When the feet are close together (perhaps even touching—fig. 4), you may feel more stress in the ankles.
You can try other hand variations, such as reverse prayer, where the backs of the hands are together (palmar flexion—fig. 2 and 3). This can be a nice counterpose after a lot of wrist extension from Down Dog or Sun Salutations.
Another option is to place your hands behind your head and gently draw the chin to the chest; this adds stress to the back of the neck.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
An easy exit is to just sit down and then slowly straighten the legs out in front of you.
A more challenging exit is to come to Dangling by straightening the legs and folding forward.
As you straighten the legs, your feet may change their alignment as well.
COUNTERPOSES
Postures that straighten the legs, extend the hips and spine, and plantarflex the ankles, such as Sphinx Pose.
For the knees—Dangling or Caterpillar.
For the ankles—Ankle Stretch, Vajrasana (sitting on the heels) or Virasana (sitting between the feet).
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations through the inner groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the thighs and lower belly may stimulate the Spleen and Stomach meridians. Sensations along the lower spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians.
If you feel this all around your ankles, you may stimulate the Stomach, Spleen, Gall Bladder and Urinary Bladder meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Two to 3 minutes at one time is plenty for most people, but you can revisit this pose a couple of times during the practice.
OTHER NOTES
The challenge for many people is getting into the pose, not the end posture itself. Coming down into Squat requires the knees to move in front of the toes to counterbalance the hips going backward; this is one reason for the arms coming forward as you descend. If your range of dorsiflexion in the ankles is restricted, you may not be able to descend easily; if so, having your feet wider or lifting your heels may make the pose doable. If this doesn’t work, try coming into Squat from sitting on the floor.
Approximately two-thirds of the world’s population goes to the bathroom this way every day! It is a natural position for humans. If you find it challenging, this may be a sign that you need to do this pose more.
A nice sequence is to go from Dangling to Squat, back to Dangling, back to Squat, over and over again, holding each position for 1 to 2 minutes.
Elbows in front of knees can be used as levers to pull the chest forward, allowing the tailbone to drop lower.
A common yoga belief claims that this can be a great pose to prepare for childbirth.
This is sometimes called Malasana. B.K.S. Iyengar claims that this posture offers relief to women suffering severe low back pain due to their menstrual cycle and strengthens the abdominal organs. 23 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the hips (flexion, external rotation, abduction) and the inner thighs/adductors (tension).
Secondary targeted area: the whole spine (flexion), the hamstrings (tension) and the inner knees (tension).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
This pose can aggravate sciatica. If you have piriformis sciatica, elevate the hips by sitting on a cushion so the knees are below the hips. If you have discogenic sciatica, avoid rounding the spine. In either case, if symptoms are made worse, avoid this pose entirely.
If you have any low back disorders that do not allow flexion of the spine, then do not allow the spine to round: keep the back as neutral as you can.
If you have any inner knee trauma or issues and if this pose creates any burning pain there, bring the legs closer together.
Contraindications from YIP: anterior total hip replacement, arthritis hip, cervical spinal stenosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, herniated lumbar disc, ischial bursitis, osteoporosis, posterior total hip replacement, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), retinal tear,
retrolisthesis, sacroiliac joint derangement, spinal fracture (vertebral body), compression fracture, torn adductor, torn hamstring.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
From a sitting position, spread your legs apart until they won’t go any further. Sitting on a cushion will help tilt your hips. Fold forward, resting your weight into your hands (fig. 2) with your arms locked straight, or rest your elbows on a block (fig. 3).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
Use a bolster to raise the hips; this makes it easier to come forward.
You can keep the hands behind the back, which may make it easier to keep the spine straight if desired.
Another option is to do Half Butterfly over one leg, then the other leg, then to do the full Straddle down the middle.
Legs can be 90° apart for stiffer students to 120° for flexible students. The full split of 180° is not necessary, but if you can do it, go for it.
If you’re more flexible, fold right down onto your abdomen. To increase sensations, sandbags along the upper spine or on the thighs can help (fig. 1).
If your head is too heavy for your neck, support it in your hands (fig. 3).
If the hamstrings feel too tight, bend the knees and place blocks under the thighs (fig. 4).
If you are very stiff, bend the knees a lot (fig. 5)! It is also okay to place the feet flat on the floor. When the knees are bent, and while sitting on a cushion, you can bend forward more easily and allow gravity to do the work.
Fold over just one leg (fig. 6) instead of down the middle. Notice the differences in sensations along the spine and hamstrings.
Use a bolster under the chest or arms if you are close to the floor (fig. 6 and 7). Using straps to hold onto the feet is okay, as long as you are not actively pulling.
Using the wall can also be great, especially if you don’t want to flex the spine at all. If the legs feel too stressed by gravity pulling them apart, you can place bolsters or blocks under the thighs or wrap a strap or 2 around the feet (fig. 8). You can also use the wall by folding toward it, allowing the wall to keep the feet apart (fig. 9). This is a nice option for pregnant students.
You can also side-bend toward one leg and rotate the chest skyward (fig. 10). If you are very flexible, hold the foot with both hands.
You can also do a sitting-up twist (fig. 11), which may help to stimulate the upper body meridians.
Pregnant women can do this pose, but if they get too close to the floor, they may want to rest on a bolster.
Very flexible students may not feel much here, and that’s okay. They are still getting benefits. 24 But if they insist on going further, they can place blocks under their hips and calves to create a platform.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Use your hands to push the floor away, and slowly roll up.
Once you are up, lean back on your hands to release the hips, tighten the leg muscles, and drag or lift your legs to bring them together. Bounce or shake out the legs. Groaning is allowed! 25
COUNTERPOSES
This was a flexion for the spine and hips, so spinal extension is nice. Do a gentle sitting backbend or lie on the belly. You can also do Cat’s Breath or flow into Tabletop (aka Hammock).
Seated twist is another way to release the spine.
This was also an external rotation and abduction for the hips, so some internal rotation and adduction, such as Windshield Wipers, may feel nice. Twisted Roots is another option.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
Sensations through the inner knees, thighs and groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the spine and/or back of the legs may stimulate the Urinary Bladder meridians.
If you are feeling sensations along the outside of the hips or through the ribcage when you add a twist, you may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
Three to 10 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
Straddle provides a gentle stress on the inner knees, which may be very therapeutic for people suffering trauma there, as long as the sensations generated are not painful.
This can be very frustrating for beginners: the adductor muscles tug on the sitting bones, as do the hamstrings, which causes the top of the hips to tilt backward, making forward folding difficult. Persistence (and bent knees!) is required. Sitting on a bolster helps.
You can sequence this into a 3-pose flow—first folding over one leg, then the other, then down the middle, holding each position for 3–5 minutes. Or start down the middle and then do each leg. While folding over a leg, you may want to add a twist for the last half of the time.
B.K.S. Iyengar calls this pose Upavista Konasana. He claims it relieves sciatic pain, prevents and treats hernia, massages the reproductive organs, relieves menstrual disorders, and corrects a prolapsed bladder or uterus. 26 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted areas: the front leg’s hip is in flexion, external rotation and perhaps abduction, while the back leg’s hip is extended.
Secondary targeted areas: in the full Swan, the spine is extended; in Sleeping Swan, tension may also be created in the glutes and along the iliotibial band.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Many knees do not like this pose. If your knees complain, have the front foot closer in, perhaps sitting on it (fig. 4), or skip this pose and do Eye-of-the-Needle Pose (fig. 11) or another hip opener.
If the back kneecap feels uncomfortable due to pressure against the floor, there are several options: pad the back knee with a blanket; or place support under the shin (fig. 8 and 9), allowing the knee to be off the floor; or keep the knee bent with the foot raised off the floor. 27
Due to asymmetric stresses in the sacroiliac joints, pregnant women may wish to avoid this pose.
Contraindications from YIP for the full Swan: anterior cruciate ligament tear, anterior total hip replacement, anterolisthesis, arthritis hip, arthritis knee, chondromalacia patellae, facet
syndrome, lateral meniscal tear, lumbar spinal stenosis, medial meniscal tear, posterior cruciate, ligament tear, posterior total hip replacement, sprained ankle, total knee replacement.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
You can come into this pose from Down Dog, Deer or hands and knees. Slide a knee between your hands, lean a bit to that side and check in with how your knee feels. If the knee is fine, flex the front foot and move it forward (fig. 1); if the knee feels stressed, bring the foot closer in toward the hip (fig. 3). You may even sit right on the foot (fig. 4). Center yourself so your weight is even. Try tucking the back toes under and sliding the back knee away. Do this a few times until your front leg’s buttock is on the floor or as low as it is going to get.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS FOR THE FULL SWAN—STAYING UPRIGHT (FIG. 1)
To protect the front knee, keep the front foot flexed; this engages the fascia all around the knee, stiffening it.
Less flexible students may rest their hands on blocks in front of them (fig. 3). Moving the hands closer to the hips increases the weight over the front hip (fig. 1). Very flexible students may clasp hands behind their low backs (fig. 5).
If you are leaning to the bent leg side, that may be perfectly okay for you. Indeed, another version of Swan is the Deer, where you have considerable weight on that front hip. If, however, you want to be more centered, place a support, such as a folded blanket, under the bent knee’s hip.
If you’re really externally rotated at the hip, try to bring your front foot forward, parallel to the front of your mat, and slide that knee more to the side. Deeper options include placing a bolster under the front shin (fig. 6) or resting that leg onto a chair, counter top, desk or stair (fig. 7).
Many students prefer to have a bolster under both hips so they can relax more and thus stay longer in the pose (fig. 8).
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS FOR THE SLEEPING SWAN—THE FOLDED FORWARD VERSION (FIG. 2)
To come into this version, keep the weight back into the hips as you walk your hands forward, lowering down in stages. If you come down too fast, all the weight goes into the front knee; so walk hands forward, but snuggle the hips back; walk forward, snuggle back; eventually, come onto the elbows or all the way down.
You can lie on a bolster placed lengthwise under the chest, or support your upper body on blocks (fig. 9). This may be ideal for pregnant women, but if that doesn’t work for them, they could stay in full Swan or do Deer Pose.
If you’re really flexible, try to bring the front foot forward, pull the bent knee more to the side, and lay your chest on top of the shin.
You may want to rest your chest on your thigh, if that is better/juicier, or to walk your chest away from the front thigh. Which version works better for you?
You may want to add a twist by threading the opposite arm from the front leg under your head and turning your chest to look up. You can raise the free arm up and behind your back (fig. 10).
Another option to the full Swan is the sitting Eye-of-the-Needle Pose (fig. 11), which maintains the back extension with the hip work. Other options include the reclining Eye- of-the-Needle Pose, Deer, Shoelace or Square.
If the targeted area is your upper thigh (quadriceps stretch), Screaming Swan is a really yang version that can be fun if tried at the end of the pose (fig. 12). Bend the back leg, reach the
hand of the same side to that heel, and pull the heel to the buttocks. (Or until the screaming starts.)
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
Use your hands to push the floor away and slowly come up. Tuck the back toes under, plant your front paws in Down Dog position, and with a nice groan, step back to the Downward Facing Puppy. If you never liked Down Dog before, you will love it now!
COUNTERPOSES
A short Down Dog is delicious. Bend one knee, lifting that heel and pushing the opposite heel down, and then switch sides repeatedly (this is sometimes called Walking the Dog). Many students also love to lift one leg up, stretching it, and then switch sides.
Child’s Pose feels really good after Down Dog and before switching to the other side of Swan.
If you were strongly externally rotating at the hips, internal rotations such as Windshield Wipers or Twisted Roots may be ideal.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
The full Swan is one posture than can stimulate all 6 lower body meridians! Sensations along the top of the back leg may indicate that the Stomach and Spleen meridians are being stimulated.
Sensation in the inner groin may stimulate the Liver and Kidney meridians. Sensations along the spine may stimulate the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians.
Sensations along the outside of the hips or the sides of the ribs (in the Twisting Swan) may stimulate the Gall Bladder meridian.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME
The full Swan is a moderately yang posture when the chest is raised: hold 1 to 3 minutes. After a couple of minutes, switch to Sleeping Swan for another 1 to 3 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
Full Swan is a deeper hip opener than Sleeping Swan because more weight is placed right above the front hip.
If you are feeling it, you are doing it! If you have lost the feeling in the targeted areas, wiggle around until you find it again. Sometimes a subtle adjustment of the legs can increase the sensation in the front hip but reduce the stress in the quadriceps of the back leg. You can decide where your priority is today.
This is also called Rajakapotasana. B.K.S. Iyengar claims it can control sexual desires due to increased blood flowing through the pubic region and can improve the health of the urinary system. 28 These claims have not been verified.
INTENTIONS AND TARGETED AREAS
Primary targeted area: flexes the toes and dorsiflexes the ankles.
Secondary targeted areas: deep flexion for the knees, mild flexion for the hips; the plantar fascia at the bottom of the foot may get a lovely stress (tension).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
If the knees complain from the deep flexion, sit up higher on cushions or blocks (fig. 2). If ankles or toe joints are very tight, don’t stay here long.
GETTING INTO THE POSE
Begin by sitting on your heels with the feet together. Tuck the toes under and try to be on the balls of the feet, not the tippy-toes (fig. 1 and 4). Reach down and tuck the little toes under—let them join the party.
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS
If the pose becomes too challenging, stand up on the knees, relieving most of the pressure on the toe joints (fig. 3). When you feel you can handle it again, sit back down on the heels.
Don’t stay if in pain!
If you need a bit more juice, allow your knees to slide more forward, deepening the flexion and stress in the toes (fig. 4).
You can combine this posture with shoulder exercises such as Eagle Arms or Cowface Arms.
If the knees are uncomfortable, place a blanket under them or a cushion between the hips and heels. You may enjoy a rolled-up towel behind the knees, which helps to release the knee joints.
COMING OUT OF THE POSE
This one can be quite juicy, so come out slowly, enjoying every single moment! Lean forward onto your hands, lift your hips forward and release your feet. Point the feet backward and sit on your heels again. Sigh! Om.
COUNTERPOSES:
Ankle Stretch, Child’s Pose or any posture that plantarflexes the ankles, such as Saddle.
MERIDIANS AND ORGANS AFFECTED
All the meridians of the lower body may be stimulated due to the stresses in the toes.
The front of the ankles also become stressed, which may help to stimulate the Stomach meridians.
RECOMMENDED HOLD TIME : Two to 3 minutes.
OTHER NOTES
Our feet are the furthest things from our minds, literally! Most of us imprison our toes all day long in shoes, and then when we are in our 70s and 80s, our toes stop working and we fall down. There is an old Daoist saying; “A person with open toes has an open mind.” Open your toes now!
This pose can become quite intense for most people fairly quickly. Monitor the level of intensity. It is better not to stay in the pose if you are in pain. Come out, rest a bit, then try again.
If doing shoulder work while holding the pose, take a break between sides. Do an Ankle Stretch, and then come back into Toe Stretch and resume the shoulder work on the other side.
Time to relax. Time to rest the body, to become younger, stronger, healthier, whole. Time for the little death of Shavasana (which literally means the “dead posture”). Shavasana symbolizes the end of your practice—a natural completion to the journey you have been on.
If you are practicing on your own, you may want to set a timer for your Shavasana. It is not uncommon for students to fall asleep. Falling asleep is okay, but most teachers prefer that you remain alert and aware while the body is relaxed. A timer will help rouse you at the end of the Shavasana. Decide how much time you need to relax. For an active yang practice, a good rule of thumb is to allow yourself 10–15% of your practice time. For the yin style, since the muscles were not used, a shorter period may be okay—maybe 5% or 8% will suffice. However, check in with your inner guide and see how much time would be right today. Most of us can benefit from a longer Shavasana regardless of what we have been doing.
Shavasana is not just a time to relax the body; in this quiet time, the mind should remain alert yet relaxed and aware of the body relaxing. Pay attention to the energies flowing. This is an ideal time to develop your ability to feel your energies. It may be difficult to do this when you are in the postures. Practicing watching the energies during your Shavasana will help you feel energy flowing at other times. As you actively relax, watch the flow of chi or prana into and out of the areas you worked in the asana practice. At first, you may have to pretend or imagine you can feel these energies. Pretending will help you look closely at these areas. In time, you will more easily notice the energy flow.
There are many ways to perform Shavasana, and many teachers have their own unique and favorite methods. Collect several ways of relaxing by taking classes with several teachers. With a larger repertoire, you can choose which way is best for any given day. The following suggestion is just one of the many possible options, and for some students, Shavasana is better done while sitting, or with legs up the wall, or while lying on their side (especially for pregnant students).
Preparing to Relax
In a yoga studio, your teacher will make sure the surroundings are suitable for relaxation. If you are practicing by yourself, make your environment quiet: disconnect phones; turn off noises; open the windows to allow fresh air in, but stay warm; put any pets into another room; turn lights down but not off completely—a completely dark room may encourage you to sleep. For the same reason, you may want to avoid doing Shavasana in bed.
Begin by letting the body become open: take off glasses and watches; let your hair down; remove anything that may constrict the flow of energy. Also experiment with removing any metallic circles you have on—things like rings, bracelets and body piercings can interfere with the flow of energy. 29 Notice any differences.
Ensure you will stay warm—put on socks and a sweater, and/or cover yourself with a blanket. If you are doing Shavasana after a sweaty yang practice, you may need to change your shirt to avoid getting too cold, but don’t wipe off any sweat; allowing sweat to dry on the body is one of the yogic healing techniques.
Make yourself comfortable as you lie down on the floor. Arms and legs can be out to the sides (fig. 1). Bending the knees a little may allow the low back to release to the floor. If you do bend the knees, place a folded blanket or bolster under them so that the legs can relax (fig. 2). Allow
the feet to fall inward or outward, whichever feels more relaxed. To allow the sacrum to lie flat, slide your tailbone away from you. Next, with your arms lying beside you, turn the palms face up. This will allow your shoulder blades to lie flat; snuggle them into the floor. Lengthen the neck slightly by pointing the chin toward your feet. You can even roll your head from side to side a few times until you find a comfortable position in the center. A shallow pillow for the head is nice. If many bolsters are available, you can use up to 5 to support the limbs and torso, as shown in fig. 3. Pregnant women may prefer to rest on their left side (fig. 4).
Get all of your fidgeting over with, then become still. Often, one or two deep breaths here with a loud sigh are delicious. Release your bones, let go completely—you are ready. Now close your eyes; time to relax.
Relaxing Completely
Scan your body slowly. Start with your toes and feet—allow your feet to relax. Feel them becoming heavy on the floor. Allow your awareness to rise up to the ankles, calves and shins. Feel them melting into the earth; no effort is needed. Feel the space in the knee joints. Move slowly higher. Relax the thighs. Feel them become heavy, warm, soft. Notice your buttocks, hips and
groin relaxing; they too become soft and warm. If you have done a lot of hip work in your practice, linger here for a while, feeling the openness, the flow of energy through the hips.
Now allow your awareness to come to the tailbone; feel your sacrum and low back release
into the floor. Feel your low back and abdominal muscles relax. Allow this sensation to rise up the spine. Feel each vertebra, the space between the vertebrae and their alignment. Allow the upper back muscles and the shoulder blades to sink into the floor. Relax your chest and all the muscles between the ribs. Come now to the shoulders, where we carry so much tension in our bodies. Let the shoulders release completely. Spend an extra moment here, and really soften. Relax your shoulders! Feel the weight of the shoulders sink into the earth. Allow this sensation of softness to flow down the arms. Relax the upper arms, the elbows and the forearms. Feel the space in the wrist joints. Feel the space around each finger and the energy in the palm of each hand.
Bring your awareness to your neck and throat, and release all tension there. Relax your jaw, lips and tongue; relax your cheeks and eyes and all the muscles around the eyes and deep in the eye sockets; relax your forehead and your scalp. Allow your head to rest heavily on the floor.
Now relax your inner organs. Bring your awareness to the reproductive organs, and either feel or imagine them relaxing. Relax your intestines and kidneys. Imagine your liver, stomach and spleen being filled with healing energies. Soften your diaphragm and lungs. Relax your heart. Let your heart become open … vast … undefended and … smiling.
Release the breath totally: let it be whatever it wants to be. Notice it—become aware of the short pauses between each breath. Relax your mind… Notice that the moment between each breath is the moment between thoughts. Enjoy those moments of complete silence and peace; feel this sense of peace growing deeper. Let this feeling of peace fill you; let it fill the space around you; let peace fill the room and beyond, touching everyone and everything.
At a deep, unconscious level, you are becoming healthier, younger, stronger, whole. While this healing will continue throughout the days ahead, all you will remember is the feeling of stillness growing within you. Enjoy this! Enjoy being relaxed—and for the days to come, enjoy being.
Coming out
When the time has arrived—the teacher is calling you, or your timer has beckoned—begin to return to life by allowing your breath to be deeper, longer. Bring some movement to your fingers and toes while you roll your head from side to side. Take a moment to move your wrists and ankles in circles: circle in both directions to stimulate energy flow again. (There is an old Daoist saying that if you roll your ankles in circles every day, you will never die of a heart attack.) When
you are ready, hug your knees to your chest in preparation for making the body small and round. Take a deep inhalation, and on the exhalation, bring your head and knees together and squeeze. Make yourself as small and as round as you can—as small as a 10-pound turkey. Release.
Wake up by stretching out the whole body. This is a natural energizer, one that many people
forget to do when they wake up in the morning. Move any supports away, stretch your legs along the floor and stretch your arms over your head. Interlock your fingers and turn the palms away from you. Press your low back down; flex your toes toward your nose. Now take a huge inhalation, fill your lungs—and stretch. Make yourself as long as possible; contract all your facial muscles, and make your face as small as possible. Push and pull yourself longer. Then release with a loud, sighing “haaah.”
Once more, flex the toes, flatten your low back, and take a big inhalation. Stretch your body. This time, open your face, mouth and eyes as wide as you can; stick your tongue out; touch your chin. Stretch! Reach! Exhale, and relax with a sigh.
Hug your knees once more into your chest, and roll to your left side; 30 pause there a
moment, and let the energy settle. Stretch out your bottom arm under your head, and use it as a pillow; enjoy how this feels.
Don’t linger too long here. Coming back to life is like being reincarnated. Don’t stay in the bardo state between Shavasana (your little death) and rebirth too long, or you may decide to stay there forever. When you are ready, spiral up to sitting and prepare for your final meditation or pranayama practice. If you still feel that you are not quite back to normal, you may want to end your practice with nadi shodhana breathing to fully balance your energies (which is described in detail in Chapter 7).
Adverse Reactions to Shavasana— A Warning!
Several studies of the relaxation response have shown that occasionally, relaxation can have adverse effects. These effects range from a feeling of being dissociated from your body or from reality, to feelings of anxiety or panic. Sometimes deeply repressed emotions start to surface. If these start to trouble you, remain calm and resolve to watch whatever unfolds with the same dispassion with which you were watching the breath during your practice. If conditions persist, seek assistance.
For some students, physiological reactions can occur; blood pressure can drop after deep relaxation, and a temporary hypoglycemic state can occur. If you are on medication, deep relaxation may intensify the effect of the drugs. Caution is advised for students taking insulin, sedatives or cardiovascular medications. If you are on medication, check with your health-care professional before beginning a yoga practice. These occurrences are rare, but it is good to be
aware that adverse reactions can happen. Don’t be alarmed. If the situation warrants help, seek it. It is okay to call 911 if you feel the situation demands it.
The practice of Yin Yoga involves stressing the yin tissues of the body safely (which means no pain), for long periods of time, while staying relaxed. Note that this definition does not specify where the tissues must be. We know that the yin tissues we are targeting are the denser, deeper, more plastic and less elastic tissues, such as the ligaments, joint capsules, cartilage, bones and fascial networks, but these tissues are found in the upper body as well as the lower body. We can apply the principles of Yin Yoga all over the body, though so far we have focused on the lower body because as we age, this area tightens up the most. From the navel down, as we get older our mobility decreases, and injuries and pathologies increase. We can, indeed, do Yin Yoga for the shoulders, neck and arms. However, in general, since these upper-body joints are not as big or stiff as those in the lower body, the recommended hold times for the postures are shorter; 1 to 3 minutes may be plenty. Pay attention, and come out of the pose if you feel anything that doesn’t feel safe or wise.
THE NECK
We carry a lot of stress in the neck and shoulder areas, especially when we spend great swaths of time typing or working with our hands. Tight neck and shoulder muscles can lead to headaches and shallow breathing. Chronically tight necks can lead to shortened ligaments and a very restricted range of motion.A very common movement pattern can be seen in the elderly. If you call a young child’s name from behind her, she may just turn her head to look at you. As an adult, she may have to turn her whole torso, from the hips. If you call an elderly person from behind, he will likely turn his whole body, moving his feet, in order to look at you. There is a saying in yoga: “You are only as young as your spine!” That includes the cervical spine.
We can work the neck in 6 main directions while we linger in Yin Yoga postures. Most of the options offered for the upper body can be done while sitting in Shoelace, Square, Straddle or Toe Squat, or while sitting with the legs comfortably crossed. Try the poses listed below while in the basic seated positions. If you have any neck issues, don’t try these until you have checked with your health-care provider. If you experience any lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea or neck pain—don’t do these poses!
Lateral ( Side) Flexion
Sit on a cushion in Shoelace or cross-legged. Keep the spine nice and long, including the neck. Drop your right ear to the right shoulder (figure 3.1). The 3 principles of the practice still apply: find a nice edge so that you feel some stress on the side of the neck away from the shoulder you are leaning toward. Become still, and stay for 1 or 2 minutes. If the edge moves, allow your ear to drop lower. Be cautious that you are not simply tilting your whole body, or worse, collapsing your spine. Keep sitting tall. If you would like a bit more stress, gently rest your right hand above your left ear to add a bit more weight (figure 3.2). Don’t pull; just let the hand relax there. When you have had enough, use your right hand to push your head back to center, and pause for a few breaths to allow the sensations to ebb away. Then try the other side.
Another option for increasing the stress of this lateral, right flexion to the cervical spine is to bring your left hand behind your back and try to wiggle the hand up between the shoulder blades as high as it can go. Drop the left shoulder down as you relax the shoulder. As the left shoulder drops, the sensation along the left side of the neck may intensify.
Forward Flexion
Most people tend to have their head hanging forward, with their ears in front of their shoulders. This is because most people spend a lot of time at a computer or watching TV: they slouch back into their chairs or couches, requiring their head to come forward in order to see the screen. Despite this chronic position, it can be healthy to take the head and neck into a deeper flexed position than is done when sitting at a desk all day. Here is your chance!
Once again, come into a seated posture such as Shoelace and sit up nice and tall. Take a deep inhalation, and deliberately try to lengthen the neck by pushing the crown of your head to the sky; this will create the space you need to move the head forward. Now stick your chin out, and as you slowly exhale, lower your chin toward your chest (figure 3.3). To help you sit up tall, bring your chest up to your chin with each inhale. Find that first edge, and give yourself time to open up. Again, just a couple of minutes here may be all you need. When you are ready to come out, use your hands to push your head back to neutral. Rest for a few breaths, relaxing the tissues you just worked.
While the chin is lowered to the chest, try some variations. If you turn your head a little to the right you may find the stress has moved a bit diagonally to the right side of the neck. No longer are you only feeling the back of the neck, nor are you feeling the side of the neck as in the lateral flexions. Now you are targeting the tissues between the side and back of the neck. If you feel you are not at your full edge, interlace the fingers of both hands and gently rest your hands
on the back of your head (figure 3.4). Again, don’t pull; the weight of your hands and arms will be enough to bring you deeper.
You may never get to a place where you feel a deep stretch here; if you have been doing yoga
for a long time, you may have already stretched out those tissues enough so that what is stopping you now is compression—your chin is hitting your chest! You have reached your ultimate limit, so there is no point pulling harder with your hands. Sometimes, compression is reached even before the chin hits the chest: the bones at the base of the skull may contact the front of the vertebrae in the neck, or two or more vertebrae may be compressing into each other. Or your chin is compressing the organs at the front of the neck, such as the vocal cords. If you feel that you are stuck due to sensations in the throat area, don’t force further. Just chill where you are.
One final comment about flexion of the neck: there are many poses in Yin Yoga where you are naturally flexing the neck. In Butterfly, Caterpillar and the variations of Straddle, your head will be hanging down, thus the neck will be in flexion. There may be no need for you to add a specific flexion exercise for your neck, because you will be in flexion so often already. Instead, you may want to work the neck in the other directions.
Twists
We can twist our neck any time we are twisting the spine as a whole. Reclining Twists provide a nice chance to twist the neck, as do many of the seated postures. In holding twists for the neck, we are not overly working the ligaments along the spine, but more often we are affecting the fascial bags that envelop the muscles.
In the Reclining Twist, as you move your legs to one side, roll your head to the other (figure 3.5). You may find you can turn the head more if you first lift your head off the floor, turn it while it is in the air, and then lower your cheek to the floor. If you feel lightheaded at all, dizzy, faint or nauseous, don’t turn your head! Or simply experiment with turning your head to other side.
In Shoelace or other seated twists, the same philosophy applies. Turn the head by allowing the chin to glide over the shoulder (figure 3.6). Find that first edge. Remember: if you are feeling it, you are doing it. No need to strain and make this a really muscular effort. Just hang out where you feel it. Time is more important than intensity. To come out, turn the head first back to neutral, and then allow the rest of your body to unwind.
Backward Extension
Earlier we noted that most people chronically position their head in front of their shoulders. This has become known as “text neck,” but it has been around a lot longer than smart phones. One consequence of this head-forward position is a closing off of the front of the neck, the throat. Moving the neck backward, called extension, can help open the throat and massage the various glands located there, such as the thyroid gland, the 4 parathyroid glands and the many salivary glands.
The way to extend the neck backward is quite simple, but caution is needed. Four major arteries bring blood to the brain: two of these are the carotid arteries, which run up the front side of the neck, and two are the vertebral arteries, which, as the name implies, run through the cervical vertebrae. When some people move their heads backward, their vertebrae compress the vertebral arteries and reduce the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in feelings of dizziness and lightheadedness. This is not good. If it happens to you, don’t do those movements.
Please note carefully the sensations you experience when you exercise your neck in any direction, but pay particular attention when you extend the neck!
Begin by sitting up nice and tall in whatever Yin Yoga pose works for you, and lengthen your neck as you inhale. This will create more space to drop the head back. As you exhale, release the weight of your head. You will probably find that you stop quite quickly: this is your edge. Be content and hang out there. Some people will stop due to compression: if you have a lot of flexibility in your neck, you may find that the back of your head will rest upon your upper back. Others may feel compression in the vertebrae of the neck. If you are stopped due to compression, be content that this is as far as you are going to go—don’t try to go further. If you do not feel these points of compression, you will probably be stopped by tension in the throat. Let that just
soak in for 1 or 2 minutes. To come out, simply bring your head back to neutral and pause for a few breaths.
Often, when we work with the neck, we think we are curving the cervical spine, but actually
all we are doing is tilting the head. People with little neck flexibility disguise their lack of movement in the neck by turning, twisting or tilting their skulls on the first two cervical vertebrae. As you do any of the above movements, try to feel the full length of the neck arching or twisting, rather than just the head moving. (You can even try placing your fingers along the neck’s spinous processes to see whether you can sense individual movements there.) The lower the vertebrae, the less range of motion it will have, so feel like you are moving your neck right from its lowest base. When you focus on the neck instead of the head, you may find that you are spreading out the intensity over more tissues: it should feel deeper. Increases in flexibility in this region will not come quickly, so be patient with the practice. Do not try to do too much too fast.
THE SHOULDERS
The shoulder is one of the most mobile and complicated joints in the body, capable of a large variety of movements. One reason is because what we refer to as shoulder movement is really 2 separate movements: that of the arm and that of the scapula. The arm has 6 degrees of freedom,
31 while the scapula can move in 8 directions. 32 If we were to analyze all the possible
combinations, we would have to look at 48 combined movements. Fortunately, we don’t need to have that many postures to keep our shoulders in optimum condition. There are a couple of classic positions for the arms that will work the shoulders quite nicely.
Cowface Arms
From sitting tall we can work the shoulders in several ways. In the classical Cowface arm position, bring your right hand up from the side, raising the hand as high as you can so the arm is beside the ear (this is full abduction at the shoulder), bend the elbow (which is flexion at the elbow), pointing the elbow forward (this is external rotation at the shoulder), and pat yourself on the back. Raise your left hand out to the side with the palm facing down, and try to rotate the palm to the back of the room or even up to the ceiling (this is internal rotation at the shoulder), then move the arm backward (extension) and slide your hand up your back (adduction). If you have
the range of motion, clasp your hands (figure 3.7); if you cannot do that, use a strap or belt and
hold it with both hands. If a strap is not handy, use your ponytail (figure 3.8). Find a place where you feel a lovely stress, and let this soak in for 2 or 3 minutes. You are externally rotating, abducting and flexing the upper arm and internally rotating, adducting and extending the lower
arm. The scapulae are mostly neutral.
A final variation is placing your hands in reverse prayer, sometimes called Paschima Namaskara (figure 3.9). This is a very juicy position for both shoulders at the same time. You can do it throughout the day: when you are walking around the house, place your arms in this position—your shoulders may loosen up quickly.
When you decide to come out of these postures, you will know right away if they worked. Your shoulders will be thanking you loudly. Come out slowly, and to release the shoulders, try pushing your hands far apart, as if you were attempting to push the walls of the room apart. This is a good time to mutter “om” and hopefully not “ow.” Now you are ready for the other side.
You may add the option of folding forward while you hold the arm positions, but if you feel that folding forward reduces your stress in either the shoulders or the hips, don’t bother. If folding forward intensifies the stress nicely, then go for it. Remember, you can do this in many different basic Yin Yoga postures, such as Square Pose or Straddle.
Eagle Arms
Another variation is called Eagle Arms: bring the right elbow out in front and under the left elbow. Try to wrap the arms as tightly as you can, and see whether you can bring your palms together. If you can’t bring the palms together, just fake it. This is not yet Eagle Arms; eagles soar, so start to move your elbows up and away from you (figure 3.10). Notice where you are
feeling this; we are now adducting the arms, but we are abducting the scapulae. This pose is a lovely antidote to the tight shoulders we develop from sitting at a computer all day. As we lift the arms we are adding flexion at the shoulders.
If you would like to go to a deeper edge, try leaning forward and resting your elbows on a
block or a bolster (figure 3.11), or hooking the elbows over the front of the knees and trying to get them, over time, to the floor. Can you straighten the arms while they are crossed? Keep working to slide them away from you. Hold for a couple of minutes. When you are finished, sit up and open the arms really wide, creating a bit of a backbend, opening the heart. Now you are ready for the other side; make sure it is the other arm that is underneath this time.
SHOULDERS  AND  ARMS
This next position adducts the scapulae, providing a lovely release to the front of the chest, and puts a deep stress into the arms, especially the elbow joints. We can do this movement while still in Shoelace, but it may be deeper to try it while in a posture we could call Sitting Swan (figure 3.12). Sitting Swan is an alternative way to work into the hips if the full Swan is too much, or anytime a hip-opening pose is not accessible. Let’s use Sitting Swan as the basic template for this arm variation.
To come into the posture, take a sitting position where your legs are straight out in front of you, lean back slightly on your hands, place your left ankle over the right knee, bend the right leg and bring the heel in toward your hip. Keep the left foot flexed to stiffen the knee a little bit. As
you hold the pose, you may find the intensity in your left hip diminishes; if so, slide the hips closer to the right foot.
Now, focus on the arms. Slowly move the hands backward away from you and lean into them (figure 3.13). Notice the stress points: you may feel this entirely in the shoulders, the elbows or the wrists. As long as you are feeling something, you are getting the benefits. Sensation is good, but don’t make it sensational—when you have had enough, after 1 or 2 minutes, come out. Shake out the arms to relax them. In a moment, do this again but switch the legs.
A deeper option may not be available while in Sitting Swan, so try this with the legs straight out in front of you. See whether you can slide the hands further behind you and bring the hands closer together. If you desire, you can drop your head back, adding extension to the neck, but remember all the neck caveats discussed earlier. Eventually, your hands may touch or overlap; this is the juiciest version meant for students who don’t feel anything in the shallower positions. Again, don’t overstay your welcome.
THE WRISTS
Body workers, typists, and musicians are just some of the people who suffer from repetitive stress syndrome (RSS), often in their wrists. A sleeve of fascia that envelops the arms becomes thicker around the wrists. This is called a retinaculum. There are also many layers of ligaments, such as the carpal ligament, that pass over the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. Repetitive, yang-like movements of the hand can damage these yin-like tissues, creating problems with names like “carpal tunnel syndrome.” 33 Yin-like exercises may help thicken and strengthen these tissues, if done properly.
If you suffer from any form of RSS, see your health-care professional before doing these exercises. As always, don’t go to where it is painful or where it hurts after you come out of the posture.
Once again, we can work the hands and wrists while luxuriating in other Yin Yoga poses. Let’s come into a sitting pose again and investigate a few options for working with the wrists in a yin manner. Raise your hands out in front of you with the palms turned up; lower the tips of your fingers to the floor and then lean over your hands, trying to bring the heel of your palms to the ground (figure 3.14). Move to the place where you feel a sensation inside the
forearm. If this is too much, move your hands closer toward you. If, in time, the sensations ebb away, you can move deeper by moving the hands further away from you and folding your chest toward your thighs. These sensations can be quite intense: don’t stay where you feel any burning. One minute here may be enough for now. When you are done, sit back up and shake out the wrists.
Now you are ready for the other side. Again, bring your hands out in front of you, but this time have the palms facing down (figure 3.15). Lower your fingertips to the floor, and lean forward so you are bringing the back of your hands to the ground. You may start to feel like some sort of prehistoric, gorilla yogi with your knuckles dragging on the ground; that just means you are doing it properly. If this is too much, move your hands closer toward you; as your edge moves, try sliding the hands further away. One minute may be enough here too. When done, sit back up and shake out the wrists.
This version of the wrist stretch is a nice counterpose for yang yogis who love flowing vinyasas that involve lots of Up Dogs and Down Dogs. You can do these two versions of wrist stretches while in Dragon, Swan, Straddle or any seated posture.
Another variation for the back of the hands is Seagull (figure 3.16). Sit up tall (or come to standing if you like), and open your arms wide to the side, with the palms facing the back of the room. Now bring the back of the hands to your armpits, keeping the fingers facing the back of the room. Snuggle your hands backward a bit more. Add more juice by lowering your wings (your elbows). You may find this yin position for the wrists a nice way to end a series of Sun
Salutations: it is similar to standing on your hands in Padahastasana. Hold for a minute or so, then release your hands and shake out the wrists.
These Yin Yoga positions by no means exhaust all the ways we can stress our upper body tissues. Feel free to develop other positions. Remember, the principles are simple—stress the tissues, play your edges, become still, hold for time, and when finished, relax and rest the area you just worked. Also remember, we are deliberately stressing these tissues: you need to feel it. Don’t be too deep or hold too long—remember Goldilocks—but do hold long enough that you are getting something.
COUNTERPOSES
In Chapter 6, the physiology of tissues is discussed, and you will be introduced to the concept of creep, which is the elongation of tissues when subjected to a constant stress. Yin Yoga generates creep, which is why we feel so fragile right afterwards. Ideally, before moving on to other endeavors, we would like to reduce the creep we created, restoring stability in the joints. If you have been targeting the spine, stiffen it with Balancing Cat, the Mini Curl Up and Plank on elbows (aka Crocodile). 34 Another nice option for the spine is called spinal flossing (aka neural mobilization). If you have been targeting the hips, stiffen them with standing poses such as Warrior 2, or do the Golden Seed.
Feel free to listen to your inner guidance, and if prompted, spontaneously erupt into whatever organic movement feels appropriate. The list of counterposes below is certainly not exhaustive, and our intention is not to describe in detail how to do yang asanas. If you wish to dive deeper into these postures or find more options, seek out a good yoga teacher.
Balancing Cat: While on all fours (hands and knees), straighten one arm out in front of you while extending the opposite leg back behind you. Ensure that the lifted leg is not too high; we do not have to arch or extend the spine—keep it as close to neutral as possible. While the spine is neutral, the muscles are engaged all around your core, helping to stiffen the spine. Hold for 30 seconds, and then switch sides. You may want to repeat this again but holding for less time on each subsequent set of holds.
Cat’s Breath: This is a nice counterpose to any spine work because it moves the spine in flexion and extension, getting rid of any kinks. As a counterpose, however, don’t try for great range of motions now; be content to simply undulate the spine. To do so, come onto your hands and knees and surf your breath; as you inhale, lift your head and drop your spine. As you exhale, arch your back up while you drop your chin to your chest. Begin the movement from the tailbone, and allow the spine to ripple from tail to head.
Down Dog and all its variations: This may be the best counterpose after Swan or Dragon. Down Dog stretches the back of the body while toning the upper body. There are many ways to be a dog, but to keep it easy, come onto all fours, tuck the toes under, and lift your knees off the floor. Be a happy dog: lift your tail. Push the floor away with your paws, and draw your heels toward the earth. They may never reach the floor, but that is okay. Just move in that direction.
Golden Seed: Designed by Paul and Suzee Grilley, this lovely, flowing sequence is done standing, which can help to stiffen and stabilize the hips and legs. (Feel free to use this at any time, not just at the end of a Yin Yoga practice—perhaps as a replacement for Sun Salutations.) Ideally, each movement is done on either an inhalation or an exhalation. To begin, stand with your feet about 3 feet apart, toes pointed slightly outward, arms at your side (fig. 3.20).
   * Inhale as you circle the arms up over your head.
   * Exhale as you push your palms to the sides of the room, turning your feet out. Squat lower while drawing the knees back so that they point over the toes. You are in the Goddess position (fig. 3.21).
   * Inhale, drawing your fingers to your shoulders, with your legs still in Goddess.
   * Exhale as you straighten your legs, square up your feet and fold, bringing hands to the floor or onto a block if the floor is too far away.
   * Inhale as you twist to the left, raising your left hand up to the sky, right hand pushing down (fig. 3.22).
   * Exhale as you switch sides: place your left palm on the floor or a block.
   * Inhale as you twist to the right, raising your right hand up to the sky, left hand grounded.
   * Exhale as you bring both hands to the earth. Turn the palms up, fingertips touching, and squat down so that your hips are the same height as your shoulders (fig. 3.23).
   * Inhale as you stand up, straighten the legs and draw your hands up to heart level, keeping the palms facing up and fingertips touching.
   * Exhale as you squat down (Goddess again). Keeping fingertips together, turn the palms to face the sky, and push your hands high above you.
   * Inhale while straightening your legs, standing tall with arms still over your head.
   * Exhale as you fold into the Dipping Bird: head down to the earth but arms up in the air behind your back, like wings (fig. 3.24).
   * Inhale to the Rocking Horse: squat down but bring your arms up in front of you, elbows bent, wrists relaxed, as if you were holding the reins of a horse (fig. 3.25).
   * Exhale as you fold again into the Dipping Bird.
   * Inhale as you stand up, knees soft (bent a little), arms rising up in front of you, also soft, wrists relaxed, until the legs are straight and your arms are over your head.
   * Exhale as you fold your wings: circle your hands to the heart center (fig. 3.26). Pause for one full breath, and begin again. Four cycles may be sufficient, but you can decide what is appropriate.
Mini Curl Up: This is another way to stiffen the core after spinal work. It is much better and far safer than sit-ups. The main emphasis for this is—less is more! Start with hands under the lumbar curve (not under the sacrum or pelvis); this will ensure that the spine stays neutral. One leg is straight along the floor, and the other leg is bent with the foot on the floor. The movement is subtle: lift the chest up 1 or 2 inches but no higher (fig. 3.27). Keep your gaze on the ceiling to prevent flexing the neck. The head will lift up with the chest, but there is no need to draw the
chin to the chest. This makes for a nice counterpose anytime the neck has been stressed, such as in Snail Pose. For stronger students, the second track is to have the elbows come off the floor.
Pentacle (aka a mini Shavasana): Paul Grilley often recommends a brief rest between each posture. Lie down on your back, spread your arms and legs, and become still for a minute. Deliberately relax and enjoy the rebound or echo of the previous posture.
Plank on elbows (aka Crocodile): This is a nice way to release the knees and tone the core of the body: the butt and gut. It is great after Saddle Pose, which can really stress the knees. It is also ideal after a sequence of postures that stressed the spine. Basically, this is the push-up position but done on forearms. Start in Sphinx Pose on elbows, tuck your toes under and lift your buttocks to the same height as your shoulders (fig. 3.28). An easier option is to allow your knees to stay on the ground (fig. 3.29). In either case, don’t let your hips sag to the floor: keep the hips at the same height as your shoulders. Thirty seconds to a minute here should be plenty. Students who need more challenge may work up to 90-second holds.
Spinal flossing (aka neural mobilization): Begin with Cat’s Breath, but add movement of the hips. This may feel counterintuitive, but as you inhale and look up, move your hips back toward your heels (fig. 3.30). You may even touch your heels with your buttocks. As you exhale and look down, round your back up and move your hips forward; you can even bend your elbows a bit to allow yourself to come more forward, like a mini push-up (fig. 3.31). Repeat several times slowly. Spinal flossing can assist with mobilizing the spinal cord and the sciatic nerves, helping them to regain their natural amount of gliding through the surrounding tissues; this may reduce or eliminate adhesions or areas of stuckness, which can entrap the nerves, causing pain.
Tabletop (aka Hammock) or Slide: These 2 counterposes can be delicious any time you have been marinating in a forward fold posture, such as Butterfly or Caterpillar. With hands behind you on the floor, lift your hips up. Your feet can be on the floor with the legs bent (fig. 3.32) or straight (having the legs straight turns this into Slide—fig. 3.33). You can make this into a flow by raising and lowering the hips in time with the breath (up on inhale, down on exhale). After 3 or 4 cycles, hold the position for 3 or 4 breaths.
Windshield Wipers: This is actually a counterpose for both external rotations, such as Shoelace, and for internal rotations, such as Saddle, because we internally and externally rotate the hips. It can be done lying down or sitting. For the sitting version (fig. 3.34), sit leaning back a bit with your arms behind you and hands on the floor, your feet wide apart and on the floor, and slowly drop the knees from side to side toward the floor. Make sure the feet are apart! If the feet are together, there is very little internal rotation in the hips. If you want to emphasize only external rotation (as a counterpose for internal rotations), work one leg outward, knee toward the floor, but keep the other leg more vertical and then switch sides (fig. 3.35). If you want to emphasize internal rotation (as a counterpose for external rotations) work one leg inward, knee close to the floor with the other leg more vertical, and then switch sides (fig. 3.36).
While it is fine to spontaneously move into any movement that feels right or that the body craves, don’t overdo it. Yang movements between yin postures should be brief. It is possible to create fusion classes, where we combine both yin and yang asanas in one class; however, we want to avoid constant switching from yang mode to yin mode and back again. If you are creating a fusion class, let each segment last for a while. Allow at least 10 to 15 minutes of constant yang practice and at least 10 to 15 minutes of yin practice to unfold at each time. Do not keep
switching back and forth more quickly than that. During a Yin Yoga class, keep the yang counterposes brief: 1 to 2 minutes should be enough.
Endnotes
   * See Goldberg, The Path of Modern Yoga. The earliest texts on Hatha Yoga made outrageous claims about the health benefits of even simple postures. For example, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika claimed that Lotus Pose (Padmasana) could cure all disease! By the early 1900s, a veneer of scientific reasoning was added to the marketing of yoga to appeal to a broad cross-section of potential practitioners. Yoga was being sold as a health cure rather than a path to spiritual liberation. These medical claims continue to be proffered right up to the present day, but now a new sensibility is arising around such pronouncements. We cannot state categorically that yoga will have any particular benefit for everybody. At best, we can say that it might help someone with a particular condition, but equally it might not. There are many anecdotes of yoga helping people with a particular condition, and rigorous scientific studies with double-blind controls are being done, which have dispelled many earlier, fanciful claims but have also pointed to some verifiable benefits for many or even most people. However, it is never possible to say that yoga will help everybody. At best, we can say that it has a potential to help certain people with certain conditions.
   * The goal of Yoga Injury Prevention (https://yip.guru) is to help people with a variety of physical conditions maintain a full and safe yoga practice by describing a list of contraindications for various postures. These contraindications are determined through searching the scientific and medical literature. As with all such efforts, the findings will evolve over time, so the dedicated student/teacher should check in with the site from time to time to see what is new.

   * The back leg’s kneecap in lunging postures like Swan or Dragon can experience uncomfortable pain from pressure against the floor. However, if the knee is bent and the foot allowed to come off the floor, the kneecap slides under the end of the femur and thus is no longer in contact with the floor, which should reduce discomfort. If it is tiring to keep the knee bent, the shin can rest against a wall or on a block or bolster for support.

   * For a detailed biomechanical explanation of why the stresses along the spine and in the pelvis may be different when the hips are pinned versus when the shoulders are pinned, see Bernie Clark, Your Spine, Your Yoga, 92–94.
   * Sitting on the heels means that the hips are flexed 90°, and for many students this reduces the amount of internal rotation available in the hip sockets. However, when the hips are fully extended, they do have enough room to internally rotate the femurs in the hip sockets. In these cases, it is better to come into the posture from lying down (via Windshield Wipers), which keeps the hips extended.
