* A Flow for the Stomach and Spleen Meridians
* A Flow for the Whole Body (working the seldom-targeted parts of the body)
* Wall Yin (a more restorative flow using the wall as a prop)
While there is a main intention for each flow, this does not mean that you will not affect other areas of the body at the same time: you will. The theme just guides your emphasis. You may add to any of these flows your own goal of mindfulness, breath work, healing imagery, soul work or any other intention that you wish to invoke.
It is easy to lose track of the time as you marinate and end up doing one side longer than the other, so you may want to use a watch that can be set to beep, buzz, flash or vibrate when time is up. The total time shown for each flow is an approximation: you can decide how long you want your practice to be. The time may be a bit longer or shorter, depending upon how long you wait between postures. You can use a separate clock or timer to keep track of the total practice time. We have allocated about 10% of the practice time to Shavasana, but you may want to extend this. We have also allocated 3 to 5 minutes for the opening meditation, but again, you may wish to lengthen this or even add a closing meditation after Shavasana.
* AN EASY BEGINNER’S FLOW
In this gentle one-hour flow, you’ll begin by working the spine and then the hips. You will finish with twisting the spine before final relaxation. Hold each posture for 3 minutes, and relax the body in any way that feels comfortable for 30 to 60 seconds between asanas. You can make this into a 90-minute practice by extending the hold times to 5 minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE SPINE
This flow will move the spine through its 6 degrees of freedom: flexion, extension, lateral flexions left and right, and twists left and right. Butterfly (or Dangling) at the beginning is a mild flexion to get started. Straddle deepens the flexion over each leg and targets the sides of the spine. Caterpillar (or Snail) is the deepest flexion. We move the spine into extension via Supported Bridge, Sphinx and/or Seal; Bananasana provides lateral flexions; and then we finish with twists of the spine. Add movement to the neck by allowing the head to move in the same direction as the torso. For flexion, the head drops forward. For extension, the head lifts up and back. For lateral flexion, allow the ear to come toward the shoulder; and for the twists, turn the cheek to the floor. Be careful if you have neck issues. For Track 3, extend the Track 2 hold times of each pose after the Straddle by an additional 2 minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE HIPS
This flow moves the femurs in the hip sockets through all 6 degrees of freedom. It includes gentle external rotation, abduction and flexion via Butterfly, abduction and flexion via Straddle, pure flexion through Caterpillar, and external rotation with Shoelace—which also combines mild adduction and flexion. With the Dragon cycle the flexion for the front hip is combined with extension for the back hip, and when you get to the Winged Dragon, external rotation and abduction happen at the front hip socket. The Saddle (or Half Saddle) adds some extension along with internal rotation. Reclining Twisted Roots combines adduction with more internal rotation. For Track 3, extend the Track 2 hold times of each pose after the Caterpillar by an additional 2 to 3 minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE LEGS
The upper thighs have 4 sides: the top (quadriceps), inner legs (adductors), backs of legs (hamstrings), and outer hips (IT band and abductors). This flow targets the fascial bags within each of the major muscle groups in all 4 quadrants. By targeting the fascia through long-held stresses, we can help stress the whole myofascial group and regain or maintain the range of motion and health of these tissues. The key to this flow is to relax: keep the muscles soft; perhaps work with your ocean breath for a few moments at the beginning. Again, for Track 3, if you wish, simply luxuriate in each position after Caterpillar for a couple more minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE SHOULDERS, ARMS AND WRISTS
This flow works the spine and hips at the same time that it works the shoulders via Eagle Arms and Cowface Arms, the elbows via Sitting Swan and the wrists while in Butterfly or Straddle. While we stress these upper body tissues, we may also stimulate the upper body meridian lines, especially the Heart and Lungs. Review the asanas we will be using for the shoulders, arms and wrists (see Chapter 3) to help you choose the options that work best. Remember, if you feel any tingling in the fingers, back off or come out of the pose. For Track 3, if you wish, simply luxuriate in each position after Anahatasana for a couple more minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE KIDNEY AND URINARY BLADDER MERIDIANS
This flow includes forward and backbends that may stimulate the Kidney and Urinary Bladder meridians. The Track 2 flow adds more stimulation to the inner groins. Any flow focusing on the spine may be very effective at stimulating and nourishing the Kidneys. Note that we start with extension of the spine; this allows a nice compression of the kidneys. For Track 3, if you wish, simply luxuriate in each position for a couple more minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER MERIDIANS
Any flows that include hip openers and twists may stimulate the Liver and Gall Bladder meridians. We can enhance the flow of energy along these lines with our breath and our attention, as described in Chapter 7. To help activate the Liver and Gall Bladder, it is useful to activate the Kidneys first. The Kidneys’ energy supports all the internal organs. You will notice that we stimulate the Kidneys early in this flow via the Bridge, Sphinx and Seal poses. For Track 3, if you wish, simply luxuriate in each position for a couple more minutes.

* A FLOW FOR THE STOMACH AND SPLEEN MERIDIANS
Any flows that include spinal or hip extensions may nourish the Stomach and Spleen. Deep twisting of the spine can also help to massage the internal organs. We can enhance the flow of energy along these lines with our breath and our attention, as described in Chapter 7. To help stimulate the Spleen and Stomach meridians, it is useful to activate the Kidneys first. The Kidneys’ energy supports all the internal organs. You will notice that we stimulate the Kidneys early in this flow via the Bridge, Saddle and Sphinx poses, but we start with Child’s Pose to compress the abdominal organs. For Track 3, if you wish, simply luxuriate in each position for a couple more minutes.
        Track 1 — 60 minutes        Track 2 — 90 minutes

* A FLOW FOR THE WHOLE BODY
This flow targets many areas of the body that get missed in our normal yoga practices, yin or yang. We will work from the tips of the toes to the top of the head and touch many places in
between. Try it all. Don’t skip the face yoga practice. 1 Heart tapping, which we do at the
beginning, may stimulate the immune system. The thymus gland is located right above the heart and beneath the sternum: when we tap, we may stimulate the cells in the thymus, whose job it is to mature the white blood stem cells. You can also imagine that you are massaging your heart. Zipper requires you to bring the soles of your feet together and interlace your toes, thus stimulating all 6 lower body meridians, which begin or end in the toes. 2 If you are not familiar with poses such as Ankle Stretch, Toe Squat and Happy Baby, review them in Chapter 3. We end with a lovely yang movement called Tantrumasana. For Track 1, hold for the minimum times shown; for Track 2 and 3, increase your hold times appropriately. Consider the times given as suggestions, not demands.
A WHOLE-BODY YIN WORKOUT
60 to 75 minutes
Meditation for 3 minutes
Heart tapping for 2 minutes
Use the tips of the fingers of your right hand to tap up and down along your sternum. Go slowly at first.
